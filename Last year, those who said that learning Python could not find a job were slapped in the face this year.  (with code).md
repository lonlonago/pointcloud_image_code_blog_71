Recently, I saw a more interesting thing on the Internet, that is, with Python surpassing the Java on the TIOBE rankings for many times and ranking second, last year, some bloggers who kept saying "not recommended to learn Python, learn Python can't find a job" actually had a big change in the plot, and actually openly admitted to the face... 

If it was a coincidence that it was ranked second for the first time in November last year, then it was second in May and June this year that some people had to start to revisit, while Python was still second in August, and both C and Java are showing signs of decline.

The purpose of writing this article is just to point out the direction for some friends who want to learn, and to give confidence to those who are learning Python. The main content shared today is: 

1. Of the current mainstream programming languages, which one is suitable for you? 

I have two specific reasons to recommend that you learn Python. 

3. Why are people who say "learn Python and can't find a job" slapped in the face? 

So here we are. 

###  Which language is suitable for you? 

When learning programming is a combination of interest and work, your mileage may vary, I will talk about it from the perspective of work, the current mainstream programming language is suitable for which field to make great progress, self-taught programming If you are looking for a job, then you should know which aspects of work you are more interested in, and then choose the corresponding language to move forward. 

1. In C language, there is a saying that goes well: 

>  Any language higher than C can be replaced by C, but any language lower than C is not sufficient to fully abstract a computer system.

 The application field of C language is as follows: The application field of C language is mainly in the system software development and application software development, especially the system software development is the most powerful, in the application software development is worse than C++, for example, C++ in the game development is more popular than C, there are many reasons, but there are not many people who really understand C on the market, and the salary of such people is much higher than that of ordinary programmers.

 2.Java Java application field is also very wide, in so many fields, it is worth noting that big data technology, server development, website applications and Android APPs, if you want to work in these directions in the future, then Java is no problem. 

3.Python

Python, as a popular language at the moment, also has a wide range of fields. Among these fields, data analytics, automated testing, crawlers, and artificial intelligence are strengths. Another trend is that Python is also emerging in web development due to its short development cycle.

 4. C++ C++ the main application areas are as follows: It is worth mentioning that the current mainstream client side games are developed with C++, the game field can be grand at the same time, the server is no doubt, server development is also C++ good play; network software C++ is also very easy to use, such as Google's chrome browser, is the use of C++ development;

Other languages, such as C #and JavaScript, have their own fields of application, and there are detailed explanations of each language's areas of expertise on the Internet. I will not add more space here. I must find the direction I want to go before starting. 

###  Second, I have two special reasons to recommend that you learn Python. 

As we all know, Python has fast learning speed and powerful functions. I don't want to go into details. Let me tell you two points that I personally think are better for learning Python: 

1. Differentiation in the workplace 

There is no doubt that for young programmers who have just entered the workplace, your competitors may be old programmers with four or five years or even more of development experience. For example, the indicators I gave to the technical department were basically "priority to experienced". 

So for the vast majority of newcomers, there seems to be no advantage other than motivation and a lot of hair. 

But its technical level, it is possible to play a differentiation, Python's entry salary is generally higher than Java, which is the recruitment platform of big data, the current master of Python programmers and not so much, and Python in recent years the momentum is very rapid, many times on the most popular programming language ranking No. 1, then it is precisely at this time, with Python into the workplace to play a differentiation, is also a good choice. 

As for someone saying that "learning Python can't get a job", I will tell you about it later.

2. By analogy, every developer knows more than one language. When we have new needs or discover new trends, we may use another language. Once you have mastered a language, you can learn another programming language to achieve the effect of analogy and get started quickly. 

Before 2010, I mainly used Java, but if I went to learn Python, it only took me less than a month, I could realize the mutual call between the two, and I learned Python in almost 2 months. In essence, many programming thinking is the same, and it did not take a long time to accept it. 

###  Why are people who say "learn Python and can't find a job" slapped in the face? 

You can often see some bloggers on self-media occasions making statements such as "Python is only suitable for making gadgets" and "learning Python can't find a job", and they are not newcomers to the workplace, but rather old programmers who have been rooted in the IT field for at least seven or eight years. 

I'm sure many people have said this, and I don't think it's necessary to be so tit-for-tat about this. 

First of all, the people who speak these words must have lived in other languages for many years. If you want to ask what language is the most promising, it must be that the language they live in is the most promising now. No one thinks that their language has no future but they still enjoy it, right? Therefore, the listener should look at this kind of speech objectively. 

Second, let's take a look at the current recruitment data, with the most in-demand Java and C++ to compare with Python, the data is not what it was in previous years. 

Let's take a look at the national recruitment situation first. 

![avatar]( 40e06026865a46408a1172f852a06a08.jpg) 

This is a data of three language-related positions I searched on 51job on August 13. Putting aside a job to recruit more people (there will be this situation), Python's current job demand in the country has approached the old C++, although it is nearly 40,000 jobs (50 * 800 = 40,000 per page) compared to Java, but 40,000 nationally, this number is not large, in the country's 661 municipal cities, the average is 60 more opportunities per city. 

60 opportunities is about 10 small companies, and maybe a larger medium-sized company has 40 or 50 programmers. 

Let's take a look at the national Internet weather vane city of Beijing! 

![avatar]( 07ced6973f534fccac879e2ceb2975de.jpg) 

In Beijing, Python job demand is even more than C++, the total number is about 68% of the Java, which is unthinkable in the past few years, this is still the outside said Python can not find a job? 

If you say that learning C language or learning PHP is not easy to find a job, I think it is understandable. I searched for C language or PHP-related positions in Beijing, and the results were only a few dozen or twenty pages of information. However, the number of Python pages shows that there is a real demand for talent in the market. 

So the question is, is it someone who can't find a job learning Python, or is it someone's favorite, or is there an ulterior motive?

###  IV. Conclusion 

Java is still the market to find the most job opportunities in the language, Big Brother status is not moving, want to learn Java based on the community of small partners can firm their own ideas. 

Python is not what some people say "can't find a job after learning", the demand for talent is still very large, and those waiting for recruitment are by no means an illusion fabricated by training institutions to lie to themselves, and there is no need for friends who want to learn Python to worry too much. 

Compared with the words that persuade you to learn or not to learn, hands-on will make you feel more comfortable and comfortable. Recently, Moments has become more popular with the saying "If you have seen the sea, you will naturally not care about the right and wrong in the pond". After you have seen and mastered more things, you will naturally not care about the right and wrong of the moment. 

So, come on!
