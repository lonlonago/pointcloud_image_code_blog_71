Using Python for data analytics is not enough to master numpy and matplotlib alone. Pandas is a key point that must be mastered. Although numpy can help us deal with numerical data, it is not enough. In many cases, in addition to numerical values, our data also includes strings, time series, etc. For example, we obtain data stored in the database through crawlers. 

Today, let's share some must-know uses of Pandas to take your data analytics skills to the next level.
