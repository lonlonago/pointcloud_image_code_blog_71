If you want to learn Python but don't want to spend money, how can you find good resources? As long as you are my fan, you can take away all the good things in this issue. 

Let me tell you how to use these things first, in case you don't know how to use them when you get them. 

(There is a way to take it away at the end of the article) 

(1) The learning path in all directions of Python (new version) 

The learning roadmap for all directions of Python includes 7 directions: Python entry, crawler, web front-end and back-end, automated testing, data analytics, and machine learning. What knowledge points should be learned in all directions are written on it, such as what should crawlers learn? A glance at the roadmap shows that good steel is spent on the blade. 

I found that some people actually took my roadmap to remove the watermark and make it their own. I was very puzzled, so I updated it with a new version, which was more comprehensive than the previous learning roadmap.

(2) Python learning videos 

More than 100 Python video tutorials, including Python beginners, crawlers, and data analytics, are you suitable for learning Python? Just follow these videos to learn.

(3) More than 100 practice projects 

More than 100 project source code, in the development environment can run out, whether you are used to pretend or use reference learning, are good.

(4) More than 200 e-books. Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes it is inconvenient to bring physical books, so I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books. 

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

(5) Other information 

Fifth, my own graphic tutorial, if you think watching the video is too slow, then take a look at the graphic tutorial. The rhythm is controlled by yourself, and the content is funny and not boring. Maybe you will laugh out loud when you look at it.

These are not very valuable things, but they are really good for learners who do not have resources or are not very good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available.

Finally, I wish you success in your studies, and don't spray if you don't like it.
