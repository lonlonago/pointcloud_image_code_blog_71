###  foreword 

I am Uncle Long, a retired programmer who has been working for more than 20 years. 

If you read this article before you start work and really get the gist of it, you can save at least three years of detours.

###  What is the salary of a programmer? 

This is a point that college students are very concerned about. After being a freshman, what is the salary of programmers? According to my experience and knowledge over the years, programmers' salaries can be divided into three categories, all of which are related to the city level: 

1. First-tier cities, large factories more than 15,000/month. As fresh students, can enter Huawei, JD.com, Ali, such as the top domestic enterprises, the salary will generally be 15,000/month, but different from other companies is that these companies will be 16 salary, 18 salary and 20 salary form, the general company is 12 salary, every month pay the same salary, then in the 16 salary company, that is, at the end of the year or a month, you can get more than 4 months salary. 

Like the company before I retired, the standard of 14 salary is a certain gap with the first-line large factories, but compared with the same industry, the treatment of programmers is still acceptable.

2. First-tier cities generally 1~ 15,000/month. Fresh graduates have limited ability, not everyone can enter first-tier factories, but there are still many graduates who choose to stay in first-tier cities, because the salary there is also good, the general graduate salary will be 1~ 15,000/month. 

After graduation, it is the choice of most programmers to go to the front line to work hard. If you can establish a firm foothold in first-tier cities, then you can surpass many small partners at the starting line. There are also many opportunities in first-tier cities. If you catch up with the trend, it is not exaggerated at all; you can also choose to work for three or five years and accumulate a considerable amount of capital before leaving the first-tier cities to develop in slower-paced places.

 So my suggestion is that if you want to be a programmer after graduation, try not to go home. It is most beneficial to go to the first line to work hard first. 3. The average salary in second- to fifth-tier cities is 4000 to 8000/month. The salary in second-tier cities is much lower than that in first-tier cities, but the cost of living is relatively low, and the pace of life will be much slower. The average salary of fresh graduates is 4 to 8K. 

I am referring to the average salary here. In fact, I have heard of programmers with a salary of 2,000, but why do you take 2,000? You can compare those with normal salaries to see the difference. 

###  Is my current situation suitable for being a programmer? 

This is a relatively common question. Many people, even those who learn computers, will ask me if I am suitable to be a programmer. Therefore, this question can be judged by basically having been exposed to programming for about a year, mainly through the following: 

1. People who like to use code to win thousands of miles away are suitable for being programmers 

No matter whether you were born in the field or not, if you like the feeling of typing code, like building the world with code, and like the sense of achievement through code, then I think you are very suitable for being a programmer, and as long as you keep working hard, you will definitely be able to make a difference in the Internet industry. 

2. People who resist writing code are not suitable for being programmers 

If you see code or think of writing code and feel conflicted, disgusted, or even want to vomit when you see code, then you are not suitable to be a programmer. 

Let me give you an example from my side. 

>  I still remember when I first came out of college, I went to the same place as an intern with my roommate. During the internship, I had to learn a lot of things. I dealt with code and algorithms every day. My roommate was particularly disgusted with writing code. At that time, the two of us could play Legends in the Internet cafe all night, but he had to go out to smoke after sitting in the seat for less than an hour. He was not a heavy smoker. He just went out to stay. He said that he was dizzy and disgusted when he saw the code. In the end, he quit his job and went to another company to work in operations.

 If you are also so afraid and averse to writing code, you feel that you should learn what you are interested in and do what you love as soon as possible.  

3. People who don't contradict the code but don't like it can try "Love over time" 

This situation is the most common. I am not very disgusted with writing code. I have more or less some ideas or small achievements in support, but I don't like it very much, because writing code requires thinking, burning my brain, or because the road to technology feels long, so in this case, I suggest you stick to it. 

As long as you continue to learn by yourself, those things that you feel unfamiliar with will gradually become familiar. Whether you are looking for a monthly salary of tens of thousands or want to be a cool technical expert, you just need to try to get along with it for a long time, and you will gradually become "in love" with it, and finally find the feeling you like. 

###  III. What should I study during college? 

After working, in addition to the many postgraduates I recruited and contacted, coupled with the continuous clarification of the technical requirements of the enterprise, I actually wanted to give some advice to the students very early on. 

1. Culture class 

Never underestimate cultural classes, such as our English, advanced mathematics, statistics, and probability, etc. We must lay a good foundation. Many programmers' project materials and technical literature are written in English, and many algorithms require advanced mathematics and other knowledge. 

Here's an example. 

>  Many small partners like to use the deciphered Chinese version of the software when installing the development environment because of their poor English foundation. I do not recommend this. I suggest that everyone use the English version and do not localize it. It is like learning to drive an automatic transmission or a manual transmission. People who have learned manual transmission have no problem driving an automatic transmission, but people who learn automatic transmission will not be able to drive a manual transmission. The same is true for software. If you are used to deciphering the Chinese version of the software, you will be helpless against the original English version of the software. 

Also, don't fail the course. The first task of college is to study. If the most important things are not done well, it will be difficult for companies to recruit you to do things.

2. Choose a language to be proficient in 

Whether it is Java, Python, or PHP, or GO language or any other language, it is OK, you only need to choose a language to learn deeply until you master more than 90%, you will be proficient, do not want anything A little bit but not proficient, so that you not only have no advantage, but also do not have the tools (language) at your disposal, it is difficult for you to do anything. 

3. Master data structures and algorithms 

After you master a language, these two are the most important things you should master. There is a saying in the programmer community that "good program = data structure + algorithm", even if you are proficient in the API of the language, it is all surface things, data structures and algorithms are the inner things, if your inner layer (except for the hardware) is rubbish, no matter how strong your surface layer is, you can't stop 100 million concurrency. 

![avatar]( 20210518213131212.jpg) 

 This thing should be well mastered in college. You may not have it when you want to learn it after you come out. Those training institutions on the market rarely explain data structures and algorithms very thoroughly. It is the safest to study in college.  

STEP 4 Master the database 

Whether it is a SQL database or a NoSQL database, it is recommended that you are proficient in one, even in artificial intelligence and big data, databases are essential, and databases are required for data storage. In a company, programmers who deal with data have relatively high salaries, just like front-end salaries are not as high as DBAs. 

If your energy and time permit, it is recommended that you choose a popular database to learn and become proficient in, such as MySQL. 

5. Learn network principles well 

Although this is just a principle, and you may not use it much at the beginning, it does not mean that it is optional, but you have not yet reached the technical level. When you reach the technical level, you will find that this thing is really important, and an excellent programmer or a technical expert is very familiar with the principles of networking. 

![avatar]( 20210518213403739.jpg) 

 Network principles involved a lot of knowledge, such as seven-layer structure, such as LP planning, HTTP, DNS, and other theoretical knowledge. Only after mastering it can the software have high performance. For example, the live broadcast software made does not have a card. If you don't understand network principles or know little, then the programmer you write will not be very easy to use.  

6. Build a sustainable maintenance project 

Rather than finding a quick project to do here or a source code to see the effect, it is better to work on a sustainable maintenance project yourself, so that you can continuously consolidate your knowledge, witness your growth, and be confident in taking it out. 

>  For example, if you go to a blog site similar to CSDN, at the beginning you don't master a lot of technology when learning the front and back end. The web address you make is very low, but it doesn't matter. You continue to learn. After learning, you can add more modules to it, such as adding video modules to it, such as adding 24-hour popularity leaderboard functions, etc. 

![avatar]( 20210518213720800.jpg) 

 Remember, don't look for open-source projects for this project. It doesn't make sense for you. You have to write your own code, continuously improve and maintain this website, and eventually you will feel a sense of accomplishment because of this achievement. In the end, I believe that you will definitely be much better than the average graduate.  

###  IV. Work or postgraduate entrance examination? 

"If you can take the postgraduate entrance examination, you must go to the postgraduate entrance examination." I have always answered this point so firmly. 

The Internet industry is now unlike more than a decade ago. Without a degree or technical skills, you don't have to worry about work. Now if you have a high school or technical secondary school degree, you are basically out of luck. Education is the stepping stone to the Internet industry. Whether it is a top factory or an ordinary company, the salary offered to highly educated people is generally higher than that of low-educated people. 

But I have to remind everyone that having a degree doesn't mean a long-term high salary. Programmers value their hands-on skills more. 

So you have to study hard after you are admitted to graduate school. 

###  V. Summary 

Not to mention the Internet volume, nor to mention the chatGPT who will replace who in a few years, in the final analysis, those who can be eliminated are those who live at the bottom of the "food chain", all walks of life are the same. 

So come on, the bigger the waves, the more expensive the fish.
