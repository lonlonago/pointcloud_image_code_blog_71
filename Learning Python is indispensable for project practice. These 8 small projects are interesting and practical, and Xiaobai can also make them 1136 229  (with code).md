The more scientific way to learn is to apply the knowledge points after understanding it. It is best to find some open-source small projects to do. You can't learn to swim while standing on the shore. You can't lose weight just by watching fitness videos. You can't learn programming without typing code yourself. 

I found eight interesting small projects on the Internet, and I also modified some faulty code to make the program run. The technical level is uneven, and everyone can choose the project that suits them.

###  Snake 

Snake is a classic project, but some of the projects found online that contain source code projects have problems running, and I can't find who did it. In the end, I can only change it myself. The speed of the changed Snake is a bit slow, so I added crawling speed to it. Hahaha, this speed is basically very few people can eat 5 red dots. If you don't believe me, try it.

###  Second, Tetris 

Tetris is the most common mini-game, not only a classic, but also full of memories. It is the most suitable way to practice Python. 

Play introduction: keyboard arrow keys left and right control left and right movement, up and down control box deformation.

###  Eight, stone, paper scissors 

This is a very simple rock-paper-scissors game for people and computers to PK. The knowledge points used are also very simple. The most used things are conditional judgment statements. Basically, as long as you learn the basics of Python, you can make it. It is very suitable for Xiaobai who has just learned. This small game also has many areas to be improved. You can try to make a rock-paper-scissors game that you are satisfied with.

I will not put the source code for the article, otherwise it will be too long. If you need the source code, you can like it and collect it and chat with me privately, and I will send you the source code.
