Following the last [❤️ word [Python basic] nanny teaching ❤️, Xiaobai quick start Python!], at the end of the time to leave you a business card management system practice project, but did not tell you the answer, let everyone to practice. 

Originally, I was not going to talk about it, because it is relatively basic, but there are many private messages from fans. I said that this project still needs to be talked about, so today I will talk about this simple version of the business card management system project. 

Although the project is simple, it combines variables, process control, functions, and other knowledge. I think it's okay to use it to check your learning after you've learned the basics. 

As the saying goes, "The bottom layer determines the superstructure". Only after mastering these basic knowledge can you move forward in the direction of subsequent crawling, web front-end and back-end development, and data analytics. If you don't learn the basics of Python well, you will be reluctant to learn other knowledge. 

If you have learned Python, it is no problem to write this thing. If you can't even write this small project, then you should make up for the basics of Python.

After roughly understanding the requirements of this operating system, let's not busy looking at the code first. Let's take a look at the effect of the code after it runs. This is what we need to do:

###  Conclusion 

Although there is some expanding knowledge here, don't underestimate yourself. Besides, on the road to development, you will inevitably touch on some things you have not learned. Is it difficult for us not to do it? Come on! 

This project is still relatively simple. After reading the above analysis, you should be able to write it yourself. Of course, the source code can also chat with me privately, and you can contribute. Come on!
