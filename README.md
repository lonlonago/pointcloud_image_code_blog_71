Recently, I have received many private messages from college fans. Most fans are confused about how to learn computer in college and find a good job after graduation. 

Maybe it's because I've been answering a lot of questions in this area recently. I really dreamed of going back to college last night. In fact, I've worked for more than 20 years, worked as an executive, started a business, and almost didn't write a book. 

You don't have to ask me in private messages whether there is any good learning method for university computers. I will write an article for you today. If you can follow this method, you can definitely beat more than 90% of the same students when you graduate. 

The article is a bit long, but it will definitely give you a good harvest!

Everyone should have heard the saying "A university without failing a course is not a complete university", right? I don't know which bastard is full and keeps putting it on the wrong child, don't fail a course! 

First, it is a waste of time to fail the make-up exam, especially for some non-professional cultural courses, such as Marx, etc. If you have the time to take the make-up exam, you may be able to find someone; 

Second, if there is a first time, there may be a second time. Failing the first time doesn't feel as serious as I imagined. There are a few more people next door who have hung up than me, and it's okay. If this kind of mentality occurs, it will be out of control.

The first language taught in many universities is C language, which may be a bit uncomfortable for college students without a basic foundation. Sometimes, it is normal to see teachers operating fiercely in class, but it is difficult to do it yourself. Ten lines of code and eight lines of error are reported, and even the pointer cannot be understood. 

But don't give up easily. The two main things that programmers do on this path are to create and solve problems. They must develop their own problem-solving skills. 

There are many ways to solve the problem. You can ask your classmates or teachers around you, or you can go to the Internet to find resources to see. If the teacher doesn't understand what he teaches, go to the Internet to find other teachers' explanations for this piece, such as courses on MOOCs at Chinese universities, such as some courses at Bilibili, some blogger's blogs, and some technical exchange groups, are all ways to solve the problem. 

As long as you persevere, you will eventually become the person you envy.

Most universities pay attention to a comprehensive approach to the training of students. The tiles fired from the same kiln are not very different. If you want to be unique, you have to jump out of this knowledge circle and extend to areas that are not covered by the training program. 

The extension here is not a blind extension, but to determine your career direction. Programmers have many sub-professions. You can check it out on Baidu, choose your favorite career, and then go to job websites such as 51job and Boss Zhipin to see more about the job requirements of related occupations. See what you need to master to do this job, and then find resources to learn these skills. After you come out, you are the person the company needs. 

![avatar]( 2373b1884d17468e9ef1fcb569a5384b.jpg) 

The school may teach you many languages, C, C++, Java, C #, Python may teach, but you have to remember that the school teaches these to take you to the beginning, the rest of the things still need you to go to deep learning, with the above mentioned career direction to learn, such as want to do backend engineer, then you can consider using Java or other languages to learn in depth. 

I remember when I went to college to do graduate recruitment, I preferred to ask "what language are you proficient in", and many college students answered "I know everything", but I don't know that this is an answer that is bound to be PASS, so those who learn computers must be proficient in at least one language, and if they can solve 90% of the problems in this language, they are proficient.

Almost all application software requires a database in the background. Crawlers, data analytics, web development, and other aspects are all involved in the database. Generally, larger-scale data will be used in the database. The computer itself is inextricably linked to a large amount of data. This is a must. 

No matter whether it is a SQL database or a NoSQL database, it is enough to master one. I suggest that college students can master the MySQL database. It is currently one of the most popular databases. Its open-source, free, and small but fast features make it popular among many small and medium-sized enterprises. 

![avatar]( 617d21c1830944b69764c410abf4cdb2.jpeg) 

If you want to be more advanced, then learn Oracle, which is currently the most popular relational database management system in the world. 

The principles of computer networking may have been rarely used when you were in college, or you didn't use them much when you first started working, but after a few years of working, you can't develop anything at the level of previous years, right? 

Good programmers are very familiar with the principles of computer networks, otherwise anything you create that involves network problems can only be attributed to the poor wifi signal, which means they are not familiar with network principles. 

At this time, if you can learn it well in college, although it won't be needed in a short time, it will be much easier to pick it up later.

All Mini Programs or software run on top of data structures. Data structures are not only used to organize data, but also greatly affect the running speed of the code. Because of different data structures, the running speed of the code may vary by many orders of magnitude. If the data structure is not good, once the amount of data is too large, the product will collapse. 

How important is the algorithm? To use an analogy, language and technology are like moves, so the algorithm is the internal strength you cultivate. No matter how eye-popping the moves are, if the internal strength is not good, it is not a matter of kicking? 

Therefore, there is a saying in the industry that "good program = data structure + algorithm". To write good programs, you must master data structures and algorithms. 

![avatar]( a86341a443eb45de8985a547c9ff8b8c.jpg) 

There are many competitions for computer-related majors, such as Ali's Tianchi Big Data Competition, Huawei's Huawei Software Elite Challenge, etc., which have a high gold content in China. For example, national competitions such as the National College Computer Ability Challenge, not to mention, if you have the opportunity, you can also participate in some international competitions, such as the ACM International College Student Programming Competition, etc., which are all good choices for experience and gold plating. 

Participating in these high-value professional competitions not only enhances your professional knowledge, but also enriches your resume. It is even possible to be directly appointed by large enterprises in the competition. 

![avatar]( 86a060aa3ba44020a9256808172f8a31.jpeg) 

Of course, not everyone can participate in professional competitions and achieve results, so in this case, I suggest doing a sustainability maintenance project, which is suitable for the vast majority of computer students. 

>  For example, if you want to build a mall website, you may only learn a little front-end HTML and CSS at the beginning, and you can only make a very simple 1.0 version of the webpage, which is so simple that you rarely see such a bad thing. It doesn't matter. After you learn JS and render more special effects for the webpage, you will start to form a 2.0 version that looks good. Then you learn back-end knowledge such as databases and servers, and you start to update it with different versions. Not only do you have front-end vision, but you also have a more complete back-end. You can even add social functions, intelligent recommendation functions, and so on. 

As you continue to maintain this project, it will continue to become more advanced and improved. Eventually, you can add it to your resume, and as soon as the work is taken out, you will say that I have developed such a website alone. The interviewer will take a look at this website and ask you some technical questions. You can also answer them. It seems that you did it yourself, so you are likely to stand out from the many interviewees. 

But remember, don't go online to find someone else's project source code to piece together directly. It's pointless. You can refer to it, but that's just a reference. You still have to write your own code. It may take a long time, but you only know what went wrong. This is your project.

Today's sharing is a bit long. If it helps you, or someone around you is in college, you can forward it for them to see. Maybe one of your casual moves can wake up the sleeping person. 

Finally, send everyone a word, not idle, idle must not be idle, come on! 

Thank you for reading and liking. I have collected a lot of technical dry goods that can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know if you have noticed when crawling data with crawlers. More and more websites have their own anti-crawling mechanisms, and crawling data is not as easy as it used to be. The current common anti-crawling mechanisms mainly include the following: 

Why do websites need an anti-crawl mechanism? There are two reasons, one is to protect website security and reduce server pressure, and the other is to protect website data security. 

Crawler technicians and anti-crawler technicians have always been like left and right hands. If you have an anti-crawl mechanism, I will have anti-crawl technology, which can be crawled immediately. 

![avatar]( 2021062519051936.jpg) 

Today, we will introduce the anti-crawling mechanism and practical countermeasures of the website in detail. Generally, websites are anti-crawling from three aspects: 

1. User request headers 2. User behavior 3. Website directory and data loading method 

The first two are easier to encounter, and most websites are anti-crawling from these angles. The third type is used by some websites that apply Ajax, which increases the difficulty of crawling (to prevent static crawlers from using Ajax technology to dynamically load pages). 

This is the most common anti-crawler mechanism. When visiting certain websites, websites usually use a header file to identify whether the visit is a crawler, as a strategy for anti-crawler. 

Then we need to disguise headers. Many websites will detect the User-Agent of Headers, and some websites will detect Referers (the anti-theft chain of some resource websites is to detect Referers). 

If you encounter such anti-crawling mechanisms, you can directly add headers to the crawler, copy the browser's User-Agent into the crawler's headers, or modify the Referer value to the target website domain name. 

It is often overlooked. Through the packet capture analysis of the request, the referer is determined, and the access request header is simulated in the program. 

For anti-crawlers that detect headers, modifying or adding headers to the crawler can be easily bypassed. 

For example, open the Sohu homepage, first take a look at the header information of the Chrome (F12 opens the developer mode) as follows: 

![avatar]( eb1d2158cf78fb1c6c6adce238ed956e.png) 

As shown in the figure, the access header information shows the browser and system information (headers contain a lot of information, among which User-Agent is an identifier of the user's browser identity, which can be queried by yourself). 

The request module in urllib in Python provides the function of simulating browser access. The code is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457742
 ```  
Access can be requested by add_header (key, value) or directly with the URL as a parameter 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457742
 ```  
Where headers is a dictionary, in this way the crawler can be simulated as a browser to access the website. 

![avatar]( 20210625190707802.jpg) 

>  I have a lot of technical dry goods in my private stash, and fans can use them for free (click here). 

There are also some websites that detect user behavior, such as multiple visits to the same page by the same IP in a short period of time, or the same account performing the same operation multiple times in a short period of time. 

This kind of anti-creep requires enough IP to deal with it. 

(1) Most websites are in the former case. In this case, it can be solved by using an IP proxy. You can write a crawler specifically, crawl the public proxy IPs on the Internet, and save them all after detection. With a large number of proxy IPs, you can change an IP every few times a request, which is easy to do in requests or urllib, so that you can easily bypass the first anti-crawler. 

Write a crawler proxy: 

Steps: 

1. The parameter is a dictionary {'type': 'proxy ip: port number'} proxy_support = urllib.request. ProxyHandler ({}) 2. Customize, create an opener opener = urllib.request. build_opener (proxy_support) 3. Install opener urllib.request. install_opener (opener) 4. Call opener opener.open (url) 

Use a large number of proxies to randomly request target websites and deal with anti-crawlers 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457742
 ```  
(2) For the second case, the next request can be made at random intervals of a few seconds after each request. Some websites with logical vulnerabilities can bypass the restriction that the same account cannot make the same request multiple times in a short period of time by requesting several times, logging out, logging in again, and continuing the request. 

Anti-crawl restrictions on accounts are generally difficult to deal with, and random requests for a few seconds may often be blocked. If you can have multiple accounts, switching to use is more effective. 

![avatar]( 20210625191729446.jpg) 

Most of the above situations appear on static pages, and there are some websites where the data we need to crawl is obtained through Ajax requests or generated through Java. 

Solution: Selenium + PhantomJS 

Selenium: Automated web testing solution that fully simulates the real browser environment and essentially all user actions 

PhantomJS: A browser without a graphical interface 

For example, obtain Taobao's personal details address: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457742
 ```  
Finally, let me summarize the anti-climbing mechanism and coping strategies mentioned earlier: 

Finally, let me tell everyone that the reptile world is indeed very interesting. Technology is innocent, and learning is OK, but the actual operation is enough, and do not touch the boundaries of the law.

It's already 2023, why is learning still limited to reading books and watching videos? 

I can't get hands-on exercise by reading books and watching videos, and I'm at a loss as soon as I type code? I learned some theoretical knowledge, but I don't know where to find project practice to stabilize my knowledge points? 

Today, I would like to recommend a few good things to you to enhance your programming learning by playing games! 

![avatar]( 7a957108afe745969831acd9f91e74ef.jpeg) 

Yes, playing games can also help you learn programming and get rid of the boring learning style. 

​ 

###  CodinGame | Gamification programming teaching platform 

Although CodinGame is related to games, it is not game development. It is just a simple game mode. The logic behind each exercise is connected to an actual game, allowing you to get real-time visual feedback, and you can also get actual rewards after completing the exercise. 

This platform is suitable for people with a certain programming foundation, and of course it also provides advanced practice at the corresponding level for experienced programmers. 

![avatar]( 3dcb6468cbd14e79bb9a098761f1e0dc.png) 

For each exercise, you can choose your favorite language from over 20 programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, etc. The company's target users are people who already know some programming basics, but also provide matching challenges for experienced programmers. 

![avatar]( aedb99fa15534c299bbbcd6334775c08.png) 

In particular, multiplayer mode has recently become popular among programmers. In multiplayer mode, you can learn the basics of artificial intelligence and compete with others to see whose code is more efficient. 

![avatar]( 710e1e1f1f934e909b20da40958fee4b.png) 

At present, CodinGame has attracted 230,000 users to sign up.

###  Second, CodeCombat | From easy to difficult games, from shallow to deep learning 

CodeCombat used to be a free code-learning game website (a pro-bono open-source project), but now some games are available for a fee, but it's still worth a try. 

Currently, Python, Javascript, CoffeeScript, Clojure, Lua, Io, and other programming languages are supported, and the website interface has been translated into dozens of languages, including simplified and traditional Chinese. 

![avatar]( baca09dfb5c944cfb815e6b06686cc03.png) 

It includes a lot of knowledge points, such as learning functions and syntax in various languages, such as HTML and algorithms. 

![avatar]( f02922e14a764104a6cd20e925ca9092.png) 

According to XIao's demo, he said: "Even the English hand code Xiaobai can play happily for a night", so it is estimated that everyone can easily get started even if they have no basics. Teleportation: https://codecombat.cn/

###  IV. Codewars | Programming Monster Upgrade Platform 

The Chinese name of Codewars is "Code Wars". Compared with other platforms, the questions given by Codewars are more suitable for actual work and life. Many questions will give the background of the questions, which is more immersive. 

Some KYU (an indicator used in Codewars to mark the difficulty of the questions) are smaller, but there are still some challenges. Many questions may require more than ten submissions in a day or two, but writing three or four hundred lines and then AC feels really great. 

Many of the questions come from games, and I often smile when I encounter these questions. 

![avatar]( ee86eb95221f42228b67257754fea5b6.png) 

CodeWars offers games in many languages, allowing you to challenge different games in a language you are familiar with.

###  SCREEPS | MMO Sandbox Game for Programmers 

SCREEPS is a massively multiplayer online sandbox game in which the core mechanism is to program your unit AI. 

The game has all the attributes of a full-fledged strategy game, in which you control your colony by writing language code, working with other players throughout the day in a persistent world. 

![avatar]( 7c91927b04e4414082c30574aefc452d.png) 

  Screeps still looked interesting, but it was still a fly in the ointment. Although Screeps was open-source and could be downloaded at will, the game's server level was charged, so they could only play the free part, limited to the initial tutorial and training ground (sandbox mode), and the game content could not be saved. 

So whether you want to enter the pit or not, you can try the free part before deciding.

If you want to learn Python but don't want to spend money, how can you find good resources? As long as you are my fan, you can take away all the good things in this issue. 

Let me tell you how to use these things first, in case you don't know how to use them when you get them. 

(There is a way to take it away at the end of the article) 

(1) The learning path in all directions of Python (new version) 

The learning roadmap for all directions of Python includes 7 directions: Python entry, crawler, web front-end and back-end, automated testing, data analytics, and machine learning. What knowledge points should be learned in all directions are written on it, such as what should crawlers learn? A glance at the roadmap shows that good steel is spent on the blade. 

I found that some people actually took my roadmap to remove the watermark and make it their own. I was very puzzled, so I updated it with a new version, which was more comprehensive than the previous learning roadmap. 

![avatar]( 8fc093dcfa1f476694c574db1242c05b.png) 

 ​​ 

(2) Python learning videos 

More than 100 Python video tutorials, including Python beginners, crawlers, and data analytics, are you suitable for learning Python? Just follow these videos to learn. 

![avatar]( d66e3ad5592f4cdcb197de0dc0438ec5.png) 

(3) More than 100 practice projects 

More than 100 project source code, in the development environment can run out, whether you are used to pretend or use reference learning, are good. 

![avatar]( f5aeb4050ab547cf90b1a028d1aacb1d.png) 

(4) More than 200 e-books. Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes it is inconvenient to bring physical books, so I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books. 

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

(5) Other information 

Fifth, my own graphic tutorial, if you think watching the video is too slow, then take a look at the graphic tutorial. The rhythm is controlled by yourself, and the content is funny and not boring. Maybe you will laugh out loud when you look at it. 

![avatar]( 9fa77af248b84885a6ec779b2ead064d.png) 

These are not very valuable things, but they are really good for learners who do not have resources or are not very good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available.

###  foreword 

I am Uncle Long, a retired programmer who has been working for more than 20 years. 

If you read this article before you start work and really get the gist of it, you can save at least three years of detours.

###  What is the salary of a programmer? 

This is a point that college students are very concerned about. After being a freshman, what is the salary of programmers? According to my experience and knowledge over the years, programmers' salaries can be divided into three categories, all of which are related to the city level: 

1. First-tier cities, large factories more than 15,000/month. As fresh students, can enter Huawei, JD.com, Ali, such as the top domestic enterprises, the salary will generally be 15,000/month, but different from other companies is that these companies will be 16 salary, 18 salary and 20 salary form, the general company is 12 salary, every month pay the same salary, then in the 16 salary company, that is, at the end of the year or a month, you can get more than 4 months salary. 

Like the company before I retired, the standard of 14 salary is a certain gap with the first-line large factories, but compared with the same industry, the treatment of programmers is still acceptable. 

![avatar]( c633017871074eadac40d7692caec049.jpeg) 

2. First-tier cities generally 1~ 15,000/month. Fresh graduates have limited ability, not everyone can enter first-tier factories, but there are still many graduates who choose to stay in first-tier cities, because the salary there is also good, the general graduate salary will be 1~ 15,000/month. 

After graduation, it is the choice of most programmers to go to the front line to work hard. If you can establish a firm foothold in first-tier cities, then you can surpass many small partners at the starting line. There are also many opportunities in first-tier cities. If you catch up with the trend, it is not exaggerated at all; you can also choose to work for three or five years and accumulate a considerable amount of capital before leaving the first-tier cities to develop in slower-paced places. 

![avatar]( 2021051821102797.jpg) 

 So my suggestion is that if you want to be a programmer after graduation, try not to go home. It is most beneficial to go to the first line to work hard first. 3. The average salary in second- to fifth-tier cities is 4000 to 8000/month. The salary in second-tier cities is much lower than that in first-tier cities, but the cost of living is relatively low, and the pace of life will be much slower. The average salary of fresh graduates is 4 to 8K. 

I am referring to the average salary here. In fact, I have heard of programmers with a salary of 2,000, but why do you take 2,000? You can compare those with normal salaries to see the difference. 

###  Is my current situation suitable for being a programmer? 

This is a relatively common question. Many people, even those who learn computers, will ask me if I am suitable to be a programmer. Therefore, this question can be judged by basically having been exposed to programming for about a year, mainly through the following: 

1. People who like to use code to win thousands of miles away are suitable for being programmers 

No matter whether you were born in the field or not, if you like the feeling of typing code, like building the world with code, and like the sense of achievement through code, then I think you are very suitable for being a programmer, and as long as you keep working hard, you will definitely be able to make a difference in the Internet industry. 

2. People who resist writing code are not suitable for being programmers 

If you see code or think of writing code and feel conflicted, disgusted, or even want to vomit when you see code, then you are not suitable to be a programmer. 

Let me give you an example from my side. 

>  I still remember when I first came out of college, I went to the same place as an intern with my roommate. During the internship, I had to learn a lot of things. I dealt with code and algorithms every day. My roommate was particularly disgusted with writing code. At that time, the two of us could play Legends in the Internet cafe all night, but he had to go out to smoke after sitting in the seat for less than an hour. He was not a heavy smoker. He just went out to stay. He said that he was dizzy and disgusted when he saw the code. In the end, he quit his job and went to another company to work in operations.

 If you are also so afraid and averse to writing code, you feel that you should learn what you are interested in and do what you love as soon as possible.  

3. People who don't contradict the code but don't like it can try "Love over time" 

This situation is the most common. I am not very disgusted with writing code. I have more or less some ideas or small achievements in support, but I don't like it very much, because writing code requires thinking, burning my brain, or because the road to technology feels long, so in this case, I suggest you stick to it. 

As long as you continue to learn by yourself, those things that you feel unfamiliar with will gradually become familiar. Whether you are looking for a monthly salary of tens of thousands or want to be a cool technical expert, you just need to try to get along with it for a long time, and you will gradually become "in love" with it, and finally find the feeling you like. 

###  III. What should I study during college? 

After working, in addition to the many postgraduates I recruited and contacted, coupled with the continuous clarification of the technical requirements of the enterprise, I actually wanted to give some advice to the students very early on. 

1. Culture class 

Never underestimate cultural classes, such as our English, advanced mathematics, statistics, and probability, etc. We must lay a good foundation. Many programmers' project materials and technical literature are written in English, and many algorithms require advanced mathematics and other knowledge. 

Here's an example. 

>  Many small partners like to use the deciphered Chinese version of the software when installing the development environment because of their poor English foundation. I do not recommend this. I suggest that everyone use the English version and do not localize it. It is like learning to drive an automatic transmission or a manual transmission. People who have learned manual transmission have no problem driving an automatic transmission, but people who learn automatic transmission will not be able to drive a manual transmission. The same is true for software. If you are used to deciphering the Chinese version of the software, you will be helpless against the original English version of the software. 

Also, don't fail the course. The first task of college is to study. If the most important things are not done well, it will be difficult for companies to recruit you to do things. 

![avatar]( 08606be9a42e415ea2526fab071ac099.jpeg) 

2. Choose a language to be proficient in 

Whether it is Java, Python, or PHP, or GO language or any other language, it is OK, you only need to choose a language to learn deeply until you master more than 90%, you will be proficient, do not want anything A little bit but not proficient, so that you not only have no advantage, but also do not have the tools (language) at your disposal, it is difficult for you to do anything. 

3. Master data structures and algorithms 

After you master a language, these two are the most important things you should master. There is a saying in the programmer community that "good program = data structure + algorithm", even if you are proficient in the API of the language, it is all surface things, data structures and algorithms are the inner things, if your inner layer (except for the hardware) is rubbish, no matter how strong your surface layer is, you can't stop 100 million concurrency. 

![avatar]( 20210518213131212.jpg) 

 This thing should be well mastered in college. You may not have it when you want to learn it after you come out. Those training institutions on the market rarely explain data structures and algorithms very thoroughly. It is the safest to study in college.  

STEP 4 Master the database 

Whether it is a SQL database or a NoSQL database, it is recommended that you are proficient in one, even in artificial intelligence and big data, databases are essential, and databases are required for data storage. In a company, programmers who deal with data have relatively high salaries, just like front-end salaries are not as high as DBAs. 

If your energy and time permit, it is recommended that you choose a popular database to learn and become proficient in, such as MySQL. 

5. Learn network principles well 

Although this is just a principle, and you may not use it much at the beginning, it does not mean that it is optional, but you have not yet reached the technical level. When you reach the technical level, you will find that this thing is really important, and an excellent programmer or a technical expert is very familiar with the principles of networking. 

![avatar]( 20210518213403739.jpg) 

 Network principles involved a lot of knowledge, such as seven-layer structure, such as LP planning, HTTP, DNS, and other theoretical knowledge. Only after mastering it can the software have high performance. For example, the live broadcast software made does not have a card. If you don't understand network principles or know little, then the programmer you write will not be very easy to use.  

6. Build a sustainable maintenance project 

Rather than finding a quick project to do here or a source code to see the effect, it is better to work on a sustainable maintenance project yourself, so that you can continuously consolidate your knowledge, witness your growth, and be confident in taking it out. 

>  For example, if you go to a blog site similar to CSDN, at the beginning you don't master a lot of technology when learning the front and back end. The web address you make is very low, but it doesn't matter. You continue to learn. After learning, you can add more modules to it, such as adding video modules to it, such as adding 24-hour popularity leaderboard functions, etc. 

![avatar]( 20210518213720800.jpg) 

 Remember, don't look for open-source projects for this project. It doesn't make sense for you. You have to write your own code, continuously improve and maintain this website, and eventually you will feel a sense of accomplishment because of this achievement. In the end, I believe that you will definitely be much better than the average graduate.  

###  IV. Work or postgraduate entrance examination? 

"If you can take the postgraduate entrance examination, you must go to the postgraduate entrance examination." I have always answered this point so firmly. 

The Internet industry is now unlike more than a decade ago. Without a degree or technical skills, you don't have to worry about work. Now if you have a high school or technical secondary school degree, you are basically out of luck. Education is the stepping stone to the Internet industry. Whether it is a top factory or an ordinary company, the salary offered to highly educated people is generally higher than that of low-educated people. 

But I have to remind everyone that having a degree doesn't mean a long-term high salary. Programmers value their hands-on skills more. 

So you have to study hard after you are admitted to graduate school. 

###  V. Summary 

Not to mention the Internet volume, nor to mention the chatGPT who will replace who in a few years, in the final analysis, those who can be eliminated are those who live at the bottom of the "food chain", all walks of life are the same. 

So come on, the bigger the waves, the more expensive the fish.

When I first started learning Python, did I often hear bosses talking about containers, iterables, iterators, generators, lists/sets/dictionary derivations, and many other concepts? In fact, this is not because the bosses just put the technical terms to install B, but these things have to be understood. It is not enough to know the basics of strings, lists, etc., especially in Python's data structures. 

![avatar]( 2ba410ec78c64b2d96bcfd183fac5018.jpg) 

Today, let's talk about the difficult concepts of containers, iterables, iterators, and generators in Python, and take your Python foundation to the next level! 

###  Container 

In Python, a container is a data structure that organizes multiple elements together, and the elements in the container can be obtained one by one iteratively. To put it bluntly, its function is just like its name: to store things (data). 

The container does not actually exist. It is not a data type, but an artificial concept. It is just a concept word created for the convenience of learning. It can use the membership operator (in or not in) to determine whether the object is in the container. 

Of course, it wasn't created by me, I don't have that much ability, it was officially created, well, don't worry, I'm teaching you some weird nouns, and no one will understand it when you say it... It's called that in python. 

![avatar]( 4e65de7e7d4f41eba25846e6ef57e294.jpg) 

Common container types include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets. 

Since the data in the container can be obtained iteratively, we have to learn a new concept: iterable objects. 

>  I have a lot of technical dry goods in my private stash, and fans can use them for free (click here). 

###  Iterable objects 

In Python, an iterable object doesn't refer to a specific data type, it refers to a container object that stores elements. 

That is to say, if there is no data stored in the container, it is not an iterable object, and not all containers are iterable objects. Containers contain but are not limited to iterable objects. 

Pay attention to two points: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Have you ever thought about how the for loop is implemented internally? For example, in this example of a for loop, why can every element in the list be output? How is it implemented internally? 

![avatar]( b9a028d2f0454756b484ffe84a77aed8.png) 

In fact, the loop does two things: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Then we don't need a for loop to output each element in the list, 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Output result: 

![avatar]( a93739168dcb443a916dc1db33f9371f.png) 

It can be seen that if we remove the line of code that prints ite, the execution effect is the same as each element in the output list of the for loop. The for loop defines the range 4 times, and actually executes 1 __iter__ () and 4 __next__ (), that is to say, the essence of the for loop accessing the iterative object is achieved through this. 

Moreover, the two things that the for loop essentially does are indispensable, that is to say, if there is no __iter__ () to return the iterator first, __next () __ cannot get the element, which just shows the second point of the two points mentioned above: an iterable object cannot be iterated independently. 

There are two built-in functions that have the same principle as them and are essentially the same. It is more convenient to use built-in functions if you want to use them, at least you don't need to write so many underscores: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
![avatar]( 2fc205b9d56e48858355262021fb2e33.png) 

It can be seen that the result is exactly the same. Since iterators are mentioned, let's take a look at what an iterator is.

>  I have a lot of technical dry goods in my private stash, and fans can use them for free (click here). 

###  Iterator 

From the example of the for loop above, we can probably see that, 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Since this is the case, when we learned the basics of Python, we said that range () is an iterable object, so it can also generate an iterator by __iter__ (). 

![avatar]( d71df4ed7b2048f68c209a8a306bfe92.png) 

###  IV. Sequence 

Sequence is also an abstract concept, which includes lists, tuples, and strings. It does not exist in itself, and is also a concept created for learning. 

Iterable objects contain sequences, and since sequences contain lists, tuples, and strings, as in our previous example, sequences can be used by iter () and next (). 

Sequences can be divided into finite sequences and infinite sequences. Finite sequences have a range, for example, range (10) has defined the range, on the contrary, infinite sequences are sequences without a limited range. 

We need to generate an infinite sequence. Here, we need to use a new module, itertools, which is a collection of iterative functions for efficient loops. It has a method count () below it, which can generate an iterator without range, which can be understood as an infinite iterator. 

![avatar]( 9fdbeb032c7c4ef69f03b4769ba78be3.png) 

From this example, we can see that as long as it is executed once, next () will fetch the contents of the iterator once and retrieve them one by one. I have only written four next () here, and you will output a few more times if you write more. 

A mechanism like next () that needs to be called when is called lazy loading mechanism, also known as lazy loading; 

On the contrary, there is hungry loading. For example, the for loop will fetch all the objects in the iterator as soon as it is executed. 

###  List derivation 

List derivation is related to the generator. Before talking about the generator, you need to know what a list derivation is. A list derivation is a method of generating a list. The syntax is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
I represents the object to be placed in the list, and the for loop is an expression. 

For example, let's use a list derivation to generate a list. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Using list derivation can easily generate the list we want. 

And there's lots of other flexible uses of it, like conditional judgment. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
If the following condition is determined to be true, the list can be generated normally. If it is false, the list derivation is invalid. At this time, l will be an empty list. 

There are other flexible uses, such as manipulating the previous i, such as doubling the value of i: 

![avatar]( 474e4417244c4665bef84250e73e54e4.png) 

We replace the iteration object with a string, which can also be output, but * represents the repeating operator in the string, so the effect becomes like this: 

![avatar]( 07b3e0047f2b4077a4ce120d75691783.png) 

Not only that, but we can also use functions to operate the previous i * 2, such as: 

![avatar]( 1639088b00854f39ac6102409066b1de.png) 

Overall, list derivations are a flexible way to quickly and customize the generation of lists. 

Then someone may draw inferences. List derivations are all operated with [], so if you use () to operate, will it generate a tuple? Let's take a look:

[] 换成（）之后，返回的是一个生成器generrator ，那么下面我们再来讲讲生成器： 

###  Generator 

Generators are objects that actually exist in Python, unlike containers, which can be called directly through next (). 

The first creation method is similar to the list derivation, that is, [] is replaced by (): 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
For example, let's generate a generator and see if we can call it directly with next (): 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
It can be seen that the generator can be called directly. So since the generator can be called by next (), then the generator is a special iterator, an iterable object. 

In addition to creating a generator in the above method, you can also create it with yield as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
For example, let's create a generator with a function containing yield: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
The result is a generator, and at this point the function fun () is no longer a function, it is a generator, and as long as yield appears in the function, the function becomes a generator. 

Why doesn't the while loop keep executing? Don't worry, let's output it: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
I called it three times, so it ran three times. The while loop exists, but it doesn't work because of the lazy loading we mentioned earlier. 

When you need it, when you use the next () call, it is lazy loading, unlike hungry loading, which generates all objects in advance. If you replace it with a for loop to complete, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574563625
 ```  
After running the program will enter an infinite loop, has been to add 1 to a, you can try to see the effect, that is, hungry Han type loading generates an iterator in advance and calls all iterator objects, hungry Han type loading takes up resources magnifying glass.

###  Summary 

The content of today's talk may sound boring, and there is nothing you can do about it. Some things may be a little "hard to swallow" for the first time. After seeing a lot, you will get used to it. You have to force yourself to try to accept and understand these abstract things. 

Finally, a diagram summarizes their relationship:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently, I saw a more interesting thing on the Internet, that is, with Python surpassing the Java on the TIOBE rankings for many times and ranking second, last year, some bloggers who kept saying "not recommended to learn Python, learn Python can't find a job" actually had a big change in the plot, and actually openly admitted to the face... 

If it was a coincidence that it was ranked second for the first time in November last year, then it was second in May and June this year that some people had to start to revisit, while Python was still second in August, and both C and Java are showing signs of decline. 

![avatar]( 38a1fe1e1fcb4712b5a8f5e6f837790f.jpg) 

The purpose of writing this article is just to point out the direction for some friends who want to learn, and to give confidence to those who are learning Python. The main content shared today is: 

1. Of the current mainstream programming languages, which one is suitable for you? 

I have two specific reasons to recommend that you learn Python. 

3. Why are people who say "learn Python and can't find a job" slapped in the face? 

So here we are. 

###  Which language is suitable for you? 

When learning programming is a combination of interest and work, your mileage may vary, I will talk about it from the perspective of work, the current mainstream programming language is suitable for which field to make great progress, self-taught programming If you are looking for a job, then you should know which aspects of work you are more interested in, and then choose the corresponding language to move forward. 

1. In C language, there is a saying that goes well: 

>  Any language higher than C can be replaced by C, but any language lower than C is not sufficient to fully abstract a computer system. 

![avatar]( 8c3c58f97acf4b2784ee019f3bdacfca.png) 

 The application field of C language is as follows: The application field of C language is mainly in the system software development and application software development, especially the system software development is the most powerful, in the application software development is worse than C++, for example, C++ in the game development is more popular than C, there are many reasons, but there are not many people who really understand C on the market, and the salary of such people is much higher than that of ordinary programmers. 

![avatar]( c6d31cbd44a247dabcc44c607c4a4d73.png) 

 2.Java Java application field is also very wide, in so many fields, it is worth noting that big data technology, server development, website applications and Android APPs, if you want to work in these directions in the future, then Java is no problem. 

3.Python 

![avatar]( 215b83b83a3f454aa9d21a1fd9f4d268.png) 

Python, as a popular language at the moment, also has a wide range of fields. Among these fields, data analytics, automated testing, crawlers, and artificial intelligence are strengths. Another trend is that Python is also emerging in web development due to its short development cycle. 

![avatar]( 24b9e75bc2484c3ca5e276c963cf8fd1.png) 

 4. C++ C++ the main application areas are as follows: It is worth mentioning that the current mainstream client side games are developed with C++, the game field can be grand at the same time, the server is no doubt, server development is also C++ good play; network software C++ is also very easy to use, such as Google's chrome browser, is the use of C++ development; 

![avatar]( 9f58026b3c344192a74280847c8b1ed0.jpg) 

Other languages, such as C #and JavaScript, have their own fields of application, and there are detailed explanations of each language's areas of expertise on the Internet. I will not add more space here. I must find the direction I want to go before starting. 

###  Second, I have two special reasons to recommend that you learn Python. 

As we all know, Python has fast learning speed and powerful functions. I don't want to go into details. Let me tell you two points that I personally think are better for learning Python: 

1. Differentiation in the workplace 

There is no doubt that for young programmers who have just entered the workplace, your competitors may be old programmers with four or five years or even more of development experience. For example, the indicators I gave to the technical department were basically "priority to experienced". 

So for the vast majority of newcomers, there seems to be no advantage other than motivation and a lot of hair. 

But its technical level, it is possible to play a differentiation, Python's entry salary is generally higher than Java, which is the recruitment platform of big data, the current master of Python programmers and not so much, and Python in recent years the momentum is very rapid, many times on the most popular programming language ranking No. 1, then it is precisely at this time, with Python into the workplace to play a differentiation, is also a good choice. 

As for someone saying that "learning Python can't get a job", I will tell you about it later.

2. By analogy, every developer knows more than one language. When we have new needs or discover new trends, we may use another language. Once you have mastered a language, you can learn another programming language to achieve the effect of analogy and get started quickly. 

Before 2010, I mainly used Java, but if I went to learn Python, it only took me less than a month, I could realize the mutual call between the two, and I learned Python in almost 2 months. In essence, many programming thinking is the same, and it did not take a long time to accept it. 

###  Why are people who say "learn Python and can't find a job" slapped in the face? 

You can often see some bloggers on self-media occasions making statements such as "Python is only suitable for making gadgets" and "learning Python can't find a job", and they are not newcomers to the workplace, but rather old programmers who have been rooted in the IT field for at least seven or eight years. 

I'm sure many people have said this, and I don't think it's necessary to be so tit-for-tat about this. 

First of all, the people who speak these words must have lived in other languages for many years. If you want to ask what language is the most promising, it must be that the language they live in is the most promising now. No one thinks that their language has no future but they still enjoy it, right? Therefore, the listener should look at this kind of speech objectively. 

Second, let's take a look at the current recruitment data, with the most in-demand Java and C++ to compare with Python, the data is not what it was in previous years. 

Let's take a look at the national recruitment situation first. 

![avatar]( 40e06026865a46408a1172f852a06a08.jpg) 

This is a data of three language-related positions I searched on 51job on August 13. Putting aside a job to recruit more people (there will be this situation), Python's current job demand in the country has approached the old C++, although it is nearly 40,000 jobs (50 * 800 = 40,000 per page) compared to Java, but 40,000 nationally, this number is not large, in the country's 661 municipal cities, the average is 60 more opportunities per city. 

60 opportunities is about 10 small companies, and maybe a larger medium-sized company has 40 or 50 programmers. 

Let's take a look at the national Internet weather vane city of Beijing! 

![avatar]( 07ced6973f534fccac879e2ceb2975de.jpg) 

In Beijing, Python job demand is even more than C++, the total number is about 68% of the Java, which is unthinkable in the past few years, this is still the outside said Python can not find a job? 

If you say that learning C language or learning PHP is not easy to find a job, I think it is understandable. I searched for C language or PHP-related positions in Beijing, and the results were only a few dozen or twenty pages of information. However, the number of Python pages shows that there is a real demand for talent in the market. 

So the question is, is it someone who can't find a job learning Python, or is it someone's favorite, or is there an ulterior motive?

###  IV. Conclusion 

Java is still the market to find the most job opportunities in the language, Big Brother status is not moving, want to learn Java based on the community of small partners can firm their own ideas. 

Python is not what some people say "can't find a job after learning", the demand for talent is still very large, and those waiting for recruitment are by no means an illusion fabricated by training institutions to lie to themselves, and there is no need for friends who want to learn Python to worry too much. 

Compared with the words that persuade you to learn or not to learn, hands-on will make you feel more comfortable and comfortable. Recently, Moments has become more popular with the saying "If you have seen the sea, you will naturally not care about the right and wrong in the pond". After you have seen and mastered more things, you will naturally not care about the right and wrong of the moment. 

So, come on!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a true story I saw a few days ago, and it's why I'm writing this article. 

A few days ago, a fan reported to me that someone from a certain institution told him that he could take orders for learning crawlers in one month, and asked this young man to sign up for the crawler course of that institution, and he could earn back more than 6,000 tuition fees in one month. Maybe because I communicate with fans a lot, the young man came to me and asked me if this was true or not, and I couldn't help but be shocked... 

Can you earn more than 6,000 yuan by learning crawlers for 1 month? There are countless people who can crawl now, and beginners can earn 6,000 yuan a month by learning crawlers in 1 month? 

![avatar]( c6520a52c08b49c78387917871279df3.jpg) 

Adhering to an objective attitude, even if I didn't believe it, I didn't come to a conclusion. Instead, I took a look at their course system, and the result was not what I expected. Most of the courses were about introductory knowledge of Python (functions, etc.), requests, and XPath. Isn't this all knowledge of some beginner crawlers? Can you earn 6000 a month? Why don't you teach young people to go to the street to grab money? 

I have also been working on making extra money for many years, and crawlers are naturally no problem. So today I will talk about 5 in-depth crawler problems to let you know the real situation of crawlers: 

>  Can the current crawler really earn 6000 yuan a month? 

>  2. Beginner reptiles can only take some small orders. What is the level of beginner reptiles? 

>  3. Intermediate crawlers are professional crawler engineers. What are the requirements? 

>  4. Advanced reptiles can be said to be the god of reptiles. What skills do you need to master? 

>  5. What do you need to learn at a higher level of crawlers? What does a peak crawler look like? 

###  Can a reptile earn 6,000 extra dollars a month? 

The answer is definitely yes, but it depends on your level of crawling skills. 

If you are just a beginner crawler, you can only rely on luck to receive orders. Some of the crawler works you can get your hands on may not be able to enter the eyes of the top gifter. Sometimes it is more difficult to pick up a technical one, and the whole effect will take several days. Most beginner crawlers will not receive orders for more than 200 yuan, and most of them are orders for tens of dollars. How many orders do you need to receive to earn 6,000 per month? Even if your average price for an order is 100 yuan, then you still need 60 orders! 

Anyone who has worked part-time knows that 60 private jobs a month is almost impossible, unless you have a special channel. 

Furthermore, aside from the beginner crawlers and even product managers, there are now so many third-party websites that offer powerful crawler functions, which can be solved by people who do not crawl for a small amount of money. For example, a certain claw fish or a certain type of collector, whether it is time or cost, it is better than paying for a novice crawler. 

![avatar]( 36c8e2f7385845d89201b716cedcb646.jpg) 

 Novices can earn 6,000 yuan a month by learning crawlers in one month. I can guarantee that this is just to encourage you to sign up for classes. This method is not uncommon in the Internet education industry, which is of mixed quality. I will directly give my conclusion: It is not worth the money. After learning, you can't earn 6,000 yuan by crawling in January. This level is not enough to make you a year.  

But if your skills reach the level of intermediate crawler or higher, it is relying on strength and luck to make money. From a technical point of view, there is no problem with taking bigger orders, and the price of an order also ranges from 300 to thousands. If the average price is 600 yuan for an order, it is no problem to make four or five orders a month to earn thousands of dollars. If you fight a little or have better skills, you may earn more, provided that you have this technology. 

It's possible to make $6,000, and I've made orders for thousands of dollars before. 

![avatar]( 1b13440bbe784f62968499eb33ce0d74.png) 

As for where to take orders is already a commonplace, I won't say much here, go to Baidu yourself, Baidu has everything, let's continue the following topic, let's see what the beginner, intermediate, advanced and peak levels of crawlers look like!

###  Second, primary reptiles 

Based on what I've known about reptiles over the years, the level of a beginner reptile looks something like this: 

![avatar]( 722e2b1572734cd9bc22d25da4d54e12.png) 

  (Recently, compared with people who stole pictures and text, the pictures have been watermarked in order to prevent unscrupulous CV Dafa. If you need source files, you can chat with me privately.) 

What can this level do? It's just crawling some basic websites, involving a bit of reverse crawling on GG. 

For example, if we go to crawl an article on a website that does not have an anti-crawl mechanism, it is enough to use libraries such as requests. We can use XPath, BeautifulSoup, PyQuery, or regular expressions to analyze the source code of the webpage, and then add a text to write and save it. 

The difficulty is not big, it is nothing more than a few method calls and circular storage. If the storage is slightly expanded, you can connect to MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Kafka, etc. to save data and achieve persistent storage. It will be more convenient to query or operate in the future. 

This was the level of a beginner crawler. It could crawl, but it was still a long way from being "able to crawl". It was conceivable that it would be more difficult to receive orders. 

![avatar]( d2e7afedc1fd4458a53c26e9b7280c09.png) 

 Then let's look back at the previous young man's matter. Can the above things be learned in a month for beginners? I think the difficulty is not small, and I will say nothing else. The entry to Python contains a lot of things.   

4 hours a day to learn. Without a basic foundation, it may take you 2 weeks to learn Python. In the remaining two weeks, can you learn and master the remaining knowledge of beginner crawlers? 

Technology is very taboo on the road of quick success. I know you can read and understand a book from start to night in just a few days, but can you use it after reading it? You read it, but you can't remember what you read. You need to practice it repeatedly. Similarly, you can learn it in a month without any problem, but whether you can stand firm or not is still a problem. 

What's more, some institutions' courses are all selective. 

###  Intermediate reptiles 

The level of an intermediate crawler can be regarded as the basic level of a professional crawler. In addition to the knowledge points of beginner crawlers, you should also master the following knowledge points: 

![avatar]( c24f969deef64b86a6011755a53bf652.png) 

When your requests are not useful (the ones that crawl down are different from those displayed on the webpage), you should think that the data source may be Ajax, and you need to understand JavaScript when analyzing the website; if you want to bypass the process of analyzing Ajax and some JavaScript logic to Crawling the data, we have to use Puppeteer, Pyppeteer, Selenium, Splash, etc. to simulate the browser to crawl. 

In addition to the crawling method, there is also the crawling speed. At this time, you need to have knowledge of multiple processes, multiple threads, and coroutines. 

If you can only crawl web pages, then you are not at the level of an intermediate crawler. You have to be able to crawl apps, which also account for half of the country. 

At this time, you will have to capture Charles and Fiddler packages, and then use them to simulate them. If the interface is encrypted, you can use mitmproxy to directly monitor the interface data or use Hook, such as Xposed. 

Another important thing when crawling the APP is to automatically crawl. If you manually poke to achieve crawling, it is useless to pay more money, this is not a personal job... The better solution is adb tools and Appium, do you think you should learn?

###  IV. Advanced reptiles 

Advanced crawlers have great advantages whether in the workplace or part-time. Advanced crawlers should master the following skills: 

![avatar]( dd365a1be07a4e4d841d6fdd61ebd388.png) 

Anyone who has come into contact with large-scale crawlers will understand that although multi-threading, multi-process, and coroutines can speed up crawling, they are still a stand-alone crawler, which is much inferior to more advanced distributed crawlers. Distributed crawlers can be regarded as enterprise-level crawlers. 

The center of gravity of distributed crawlers lies in resource sharing, so what we need to master is RabbitMQ, Celery, and Kafka, which are used to implement distribution with these basic queues or components; followed by our famous Scrapy crawler framework, which is also the most widely used crawler framework at present. It is essential to understand and master Scrapy's Redis, Redis-BloomFilter, and Cluster. 

After mastering these things, your crawler can achieve enterprise-level high-efficiency crawlers. 

![avatar]( c77bc10633f140ac825ea2103171a274.jpg) 

Another focus that advanced crawler levels should consider is anti-crawling. 

The common operation of the anti-crawl mechanism is the verification code, what slider verification ah, physical check ah, addition and subtraction ah, etc., the moves are endless, this time you have to know how to deal with these common verification code. 

There is also the common IP detection in anti-crawling, which may block your number, so coping methods are also necessary. Whether you use a free proxy or a paid proxy to change the proxy IP, it is possible. 

As well as the shunt technology to deal with anti-climbing to avoid account blocking, shunt technology has to build a pool, Cookies pool, Token pool, Sign pool, you can, with the pool, your probability of being blocked will be reduced, you don't want to climb an official account result WX was blocked, right? 

![avatar]( 2e06f9aa133c4456bb3aa44ec42891f0.jpg) 

###  Fifth, higher-level reptiles (the pinnacle of reptiles) 

For higher-level crawlers, the following 4 points are essential: 

![avatar]( 489c71221b2a401b963449d7b52a5ae9.png) 

Why learn JS reverse crawling? In the fight between reverse crawling and reverse crawling, it is also possible to use Selenium and other methods to crawl, but the efficiency is still low. After all, it simulates the entire process of web page rendering, and the real data may only be hidden in a small interface. Therefore, JS reverse crawling is a higher-level crawling technology, especially in large-scale website data crawling, such as a lot and a treasure. If you can use JS reverse crawling, it is undoubtedly one of the proof of technical excellence, but JS reverse is not something that everyone can refine. It does burn hair. 

Not to mention the reverse of the APP, the web page can be reversed, and the APP can also be reversed, so you deserve the word "awesome". 

What is an intelligent crawler? For example, under normal circumstances, a crawler that crawls a novel website needs to write different extraction rules according to different websites in order to extract the desired content. And if you use intelligent analysis, no matter which website it is, you only need to pass the URL of the webpage to it, and you can intelligently identify the title, content, update time and other information through the algorithm, without repeatedly writing extraction rules. 

Intelligent crawler, in short, is the combination of crawler and machine learning technology, making crawler more intelligent, otherwise, to crawl 10,000 website, do we have to write 10,000 crawler script? 

![avatar]( 26d1a748b6fd41e6b1794a31a36556eb.jpg) 

When did crawlers become involved in operations and maintenance? They have always had an inseparable relationship, but your crawler needs or level have not been met, so they will not be considered. 

The relationship between crawlers and operation and maintenance is mainly reflected in the deployment and distribution, data storage and monitoring. 

For example, how to quickly deploy a crawler to 100 hosts? For example, how to monitor the memory and CPU status of some crawlers? For example, how can crawlers set up alarm mechanisms to ensure the safety of crawler projects? 

Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana are the most used technologies in the operation and maintenance of crawlers, and I often use them to escort when doing larger crawler projects. 

What is a peak? There may never be a peak... As long as I don't have the hairstyle of a powerhouse (completely bald) for a day, I dare not say that I have seen a peak... 

I vaguely feel that the crawler has achieved the extreme, capable of doing both full stack and data analytics. It is better to say that it is still a master of algorithms. Maybe it can also make achievements in artificial intelligence. Is this the peak of crawlers? 

Today's sharing is here, may you and I both become men at the top of the pyramid!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The more scientific way to learn is to apply the knowledge points after understanding it. It is best to find some open-source small projects to do. You can't learn to swim while standing on the shore. You can't lose weight just by watching fitness videos. You can't learn programming without typing code yourself. 

I found eight interesting small projects on the Internet, and I also modified some faulty code to make the program run. The technical level is uneven, and everyone can choose the project that suits them.

###  Snake 

Snake is a classic project, but some of the projects found online that contain source code projects have problems running, and I can't find who did it. In the end, I can only change it myself. The speed of the changed Snake is a bit slow, so I added crawling speed to it. Hahaha, this speed is basically very few people can eat 5 red dots. If you don't believe me, try it.

###  Second, Tetris 

Tetris is the most common mini-game, not only a classic, but also full of memories. It is the most suitable way to practice Python. 

Play introduction: keyboard arrow keys left and right control left and right movement, up and down control box deformation.

###  Eight, stone, paper scissors 

This is a very simple rock-paper-scissors game for people and computers to PK. The knowledge points used are also very simple. The most used things are conditional judgment statements. Basically, as long as you learn the basics of Python, you can make it. It is very suitable for Xiaobai who has just learned. This small game also has many areas to be improved. You can try to make a rock-paper-scissors game that you are satisfied with.

###  Are you still using the traditional development interface? 

It's not better than not knowing, it's a surprise, it's 2023, are you still writing code with Pycharm's default background? It's outdated. 

![avatar]( c169e38b2d094d188d9ba9a06e5cea7f.png) 

But after reading the background of the development environment of young people now, I am ashamed to see it. 

![avatar]( 75dcd3408aa74cfa93f46e37a5d4db4b.jpeg) 

Later, I will introduce to you how to change the background. 

###  The interface of young people 

Let's take a look at the development interface of young people today. I find the last one rather bizarre. 

![avatar]( 427a462843b54573be7e7e25193c2e27.png) 

 I heard that it is a popular anime in China. I have never read it, but I have read a lot of novels.   

I've even seen a female programmer's pycharm interface look like this, directly putting Peng Yuyan up. 

![avatar]( fdbe2d52e9c34262ba201a78807ac7ca.png) 

Some young people even hung Internet celebrity photos directly on the interface, saying that it was more refreshing than drinking Red Bull... 

![avatar]( 9d3b60f39c2040b2bbd5e21433522483.png) 

And mine is relatively low, after all, not young...... 

![avatar]( 398361f9a5024a349526ac1a7d104270.png) 

Next, let me share with you how to change the background of your pycharm. 

###  Third, the operation of changing the background 

It only takes three steps to make your PyCharm interface unique. 

Open PyCharm, click File, and select Settings. 

![avatar]( 47c706552ada4a63b6d8d62b17406107.png) 

In the Appearance & Behavior option, click Appearance, click Background Image. 

![avatar]( 48ba01b4593d453fa100881deb2fce7d.png) 

Click on the "..." place in the upper right corner, and you can choose the picture you want to use as the background. After confirming, choose the display method you like. I think the second method is still good. 

![avatar]( 32cb1bf3e00b4490a9fea1147557bd2f.png) 

The last thing is to set the brightness of the background image. I suggest that the brighter background should be about the same at 10% transparency. If it is too bright, it will affect the code, personal preference and picture color.

NetEase Cloud Music has always been a great platform for listening to music, especially the recommendation algorithm. I personally think it is more popular than a certain Q music. I have always used NetEase Cloud to listen to music. 

![avatar]( 20210626154515967.png) 

Today, I will teach you a way to crawl the comments of any song in the NetEase cloud and generate a special word map. Those who are interested in crawlers can try to practice their hands. After mastering the method, they can crawl any song they want. 

###  First, the effect 

Let's take a look at the effect of the final word picture effect, still "No Man's Island" as an example, although it is a song 3 years ago, but there are still many listeners like this song, so far there have been more than 250,000 comments. 

![avatar]( 20210626154748480.png) 

Let's take a look at what 250,000 people were saying while listening to this song, and see the renderings crawled out by the comments: 

![avatar]( 20210609140925390.jpg) 

###  Second, the technology used 

This technical difficulty is not large, mainly using selenium and several third-party libraries can be achieved, first give you a simple technical explanation. 

Selenium is a tool for web application testing. Selenium tests run directly in the browser, just like a real user, without being suspected by the website to be crawled. 

Automatically render all response content, which can directly bypass the operation of js encryption. As long as the data is displayed on the browser, it can be obtained by the headless browser, and it can be almost visible and crawled. 

Jieba library, wordcloud library, MySQLdb, numpy library. 

###  III. Source code analysis 

1. Crawl the comments into the library section. 

![avatar]( 20210609142819244.jpg) 

  2. Perform renderings display visualization. 

![avatar]( 20210609144113129.jpg) 

If you need the source code, you can leave a message "NetEase Cloud" in the comment area below, then chat with me privately, and I will send you the source code, or find my assistant in my technical exchange group. 

###  Fourth, crawl any song comments 

After mastering this method, we can not only climb "No Man's Island", but also climb other songs. The method is the same, and it can be completed through these few steps. 

First of all, there is a URL for the request URL in our code, which is the string of addresses in the address bar. It needs to be declared that it is only for the songs of the web version of the NetEase Cloud Music official website. The example picture is as follows: 

![avatar]( 20210609145023219.jpg) 

![avatar]( 20210609144953811.jpg) 

  If you still need visualization, just follow the above method. Thank you for reading and liking. I have collected a lot of technical dry goods, which can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:

Using Python for data analytics is not enough to master numpy and matplotlib alone. Pandas is a key point that must be mastered. Although numpy can help us deal with numerical data, it is not enough. In many cases, in addition to numerical values, our data also includes strings, time series, etc. For example, we obtain data stored in the database through crawlers. 

Today, let's share some must-know uses of Pandas to take your data analytics skills to the next level.

###  Conclusion 

The article summarizes some of the commonly used methods of Pandas. As for some basic concepts, you need to understand them when you learn Pandas. For example, what is Series? What is DataFrame? If you have a clear understanding of these basic things of Pandas and use these methods in the article, then you will be able to handle data processing and analysis with Pandas with ease.

Pycharm, as one of the most commonly used IDEs for Python development, is not only compatible, but also quite rich in features, such as debugging, syntax highlighting, smart prompts, etc. It also supports web development frameworks such as Django, etc. Once you are familiar with it, the development efficiency is quite high. 

![avatar]( 1e6bde0d0f68484281626f84bf30c0b8.jpg) 

 But for beginners, Pycharm is also a double-edged sword with rich features. Some small partners will inevitably be confused when they see a bunch of English interfaces just after getting started. Hahaha, it doesn't matter. Today, I will teach you 11 of Pycharm's most commonly used skills, as well as some shortcuts commonly used by pycharm, allowing you to quickly get started with Python, the most commonly used IDE in Pycharm development, and keep up with the speed of old drivers!  

###  First, common tips 

Click "File" in the upper left corner, select "Settings", enter "font" to find "Font", and set the number in "Size". The default is 12, and 18 or 20 is recommended. 

![avatar]( 911f28b9095b485d9cb44d39d6d41aa6.png) 

Here are some differences from the above. The above is to adjust the code text size, but it does not change the text size of the menu interface. If your menu interface text is relatively small, such as this: 

![avatar]( ab8ee02d893e4c0aa20b5a74cbc58927.png) 

  Then you need to adjust the text size of the menu interface. Click "File" in the upper left corner, select "Settings", enter "font", and find "Appearance". After checking in front of "Use custom font", you can choose your favorite font size in the Size at the back. 

![avatar]( fbc94d2d602249c8ab8841d8ff9b47f6.png) 

Although we can use "#" to comment on a single line of code, if there are multiple lines of code that need to be commented, it is a bit troublesome to type "#" line by line. Here we can use the mouse to select multiple lines of code, and then press Ctrl +/to comment on multiple lines of code. At the same time, we can also uncomment multiple lines of code. 

![avatar]( 883154ce0fc04884b87285f0b54bc6dc.gif) 

When we first start writing code, it is inevitable that the code will be written in an irregular manner. Although it does not affect the operation, the readability is relatively low, especially when you read a long and irregular code, you will experience the pain. 

For example, this kind of irregular spelling gives you a few spaces in the middle from time to time. 

![avatar]( a7bba2fd0eef44e18c010e4a8eb129b6.png) 

  This problem is actually very easy to solve. We just need to find "Code" in the menu bar after writing the code, and click "Reformat Code" to automatically standardize the code. 

![avatar]( c35b5bdb9aff451a8c41cefbeeeca762.gif) 

When writing code, we often have to define a lot of variables or classes. Variables or classes may be used in multiple places when writing code. If we need to modify all the variables or classes in the code, should we modify them one by one? 

Of course not, we just need to select the variable or class that needs to be renamed, right-click the pop-up option and select Refactor, and then click Rename to make global modifications. 

For example, if I want to change all "n" variables in my code to "i", then do the following: 

![avatar]( 6a938ea1173a4d209ab4ac9721e4b055.gif) 

When our code is relatively long, it is very troublesome to swipe from beginning to end to find a variable or function. At this time, we need to use the shortcut Ctrl + f to quickly find it. 

For example, I want to find out where the "runGame" function is used in the Snake project, so we just need to use Ctrl + f to bring up the small window, and then enter the keyword "runGame" to find all the places where "runGame" appears in the code. 

![avatar]( de8997afc1cf45278c5cb500a7a1c2b0.gif) 

When writing a project, it is often necessary to modify it, and sometimes it needs to be changed back and forth for several days to complete, but if we open pycharm today to add a new function, we don't want it after doing it for a long time, and we want to get back yesterday's version, but it takes a long time, and the revocation can't be pulled back. What should we do? 

At this time, you need to find the modification history. Pycharm is still very user-friendly. Every step you make changes, it saves a history for you. Just right-click the file and find all the historical versions in Local History. 

Take the simplest example, for example, my current code has an extra function to do "prompt'execution is over 'after execution is completed", I don't need it, but I can't undo it at the moment, what should I do? At this time, we can go to Local History to find the historical version and change the existing version back to the historical version. (Except for direct deletion, direct deletion is not our purpose) 

![avatar]( 89695dcb953b41d88da3c656ac76a12b.gif) 

When we use pip to install some resources, pycharm will download foreign resources for us by default. Sometimes the installation fails due to network and other problems. In fact, we can configure it and let it download domestic resources. 

The most common is to go to the open-source mirror station of Tsinghua University to download. We only need to set this up in pycharm, and it will be downloaded in China in the future. 

Setup method: click "File" in the upper right corner → click "Settings" → find "Python interpreter" under Project → click "+" → click "Manage Repositories" → click "+" → Enter the address of Tsinghua University Open Source Software Mirror Station: https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

When writing code to implement certain functions, we often have to install packages, so it is necessary to master the function of installing packages for pycharm. 

Method: 

Click "File" in the upper left corner → click "Settings" → find "Python interpreter" under Project → click "+" → enter the name of the package you want to install, such as "pygame", and then click "Install Package" below to start the installation. After the installation is complete, you can use it. 

![avatar]( d5746ce77c9a48998bee3155934649ae.gif) 

  Note that it can only be used after the installation is completed, and there will be a download progress bar at the bottom of the interface: 

![avatar]( 3352dce2a29841d194e148fdb6b8ea33.png) 

When writing code, it is easy to report errors, but sometimes it is difficult for us to see the problem on the surface. Therefore, we need to debug at this time, which is also a commonly used technique in the development process. 

How to debug? Click on the left side of the line of code that you think may go wrong, and a red dot will appear. We call it a breakpoint. As long as the program runs to the breakpoint, it will automatically stop. After setting the breakpoint, we right-click "Debug project name" to run, and then go to the run interface. We can walk step by step and see the changes in the values of some variables inside. 

![avatar]( b9aa4bcb1c5641e6bf8e58e9d4d555a6.gif) 

There are also many ways to debug, and you can search for specific debugging skills online. I won't explain too much here. 

This is an additional function. You can set a personalized background for your pycharm, depending on your personal needs. If you want to set it, you can set it up. After all, reading English and numbers when writing code is quite tiring. Occasionally, you can also look at something else, such as your girlfriend. 

![avatar]( f2b747a612be4158bbebfb5ed3fc5ddf.png) 

  Setup method: 

① Open pycharm, click File, and select Settings. 

② Under the Appearance & Behavior option, click Appearance, click Background Image. 

③ Click on the "..." place in the upper right corner, and you can choose the picture you want to use as the background. After confirming, choose the display method you like. I think the second method is still good. 

The last thing is to set the brightness of the background image. I suggest that the brighter background should be about the same at 10% transparency. If it is too bright, it will affect the code, personal preference and picture color. 

(To clarify, that background is not mine.)

###  Common shortcuts 

Finally, I will attach a summary of Pycharm's commonly used shortcuts. I wish you all the best in the process of writing code. 

![avatar]( 50716b350cc047abb58a1ba971831e4e.jpg) 

  Recently, there have been too many stolen pictures and stolen texts, so I can only add watermarks. If there is no watermark, you can chat with me privately, or you can organize some of your commonly used ones yourself. 

###  Conclusion 

I would like to advise those who are not good at English and are afraid of English software not to install the Chinese version of the development software because of this. In addition to the fact that the Chinese version does not have the native English version, the stability will be better. The biggest reason is that the vast majority of mainstream development software now uses the original English version. If you permanently use the Chinese version, you will be helpless if you encounter the English version of the software one day. 

Just like when we learn to drive, if you learn automatic transmission, then one day you will be given a manual transmission, you will not be able to drive, but if you learn manual transmission, then it is also easy to drive automatic transmission. 

![avatar]( d9935be2969b4aa9aa3fa894882d5fdc.gif) 

The Chinese version is like an automatic transmission, and the original English version is like a manual transmission. Don't be afraid just because you don't understand English at first. I'm not sampling, I'm just posting, the original version will be better, of course, there are exceptions to everything. If you learn easy language, then the Chinese version of the software is undoubtedly the best.

Following the last [❤️ word [Python basic] nanny teaching ❤️, Xiaobai quick start Python!], at the end of the time to leave you a business card management system practice project, but did not tell you the answer, let everyone to practice. 

Originally, I was not going to talk about it, because it is relatively basic, but there are many private messages from fans. I said that this project still needs to be talked about, so today I will talk about this simple version of the business card management system project. 

Although the project is simple, it combines variables, process control, functions, and other knowledge. I think it's okay to use it to check your learning after you've learned the basics. 

As the saying goes, "The bottom layer determines the superstructure". Only after mastering these basic knowledge can you move forward in the direction of subsequent crawling, web front-end and back-end development, and data analytics. If you don't learn the basics of Python well, you will be reluctant to learn other knowledge. 

If you have learned Python, it is no problem to write this thing. If you can't even write this small project, then you should make up for the basics of Python.

In the Python official website also provides the installation package for the Linux system. In the main distribution of the Linux system, it can be divided into Deb system and RPM system according to its software package format. Linux system and Windows system have a very important difference: Linux system is completely free and open source, while Windows system is paid and closed source. In enterprises, Linux system is usually used as a server. Deb system is more representative of Ubuntu and Debian. Ubuntu is mainly used as a desktop operating system, Debian is used as a server operating system.

##  1.2.2 install Python on Linux systems 

In this tutorial, the author takes the CentOS system in the RPM department as an example to demonstrate how to install python in the Linux. Students should note that this is only to explain how to install the Python interpreter in the Linux system. For beginners, it is most convenient to learn Python directly using the Windows system. Regarding the installation of the Python interpreter, please follow the steps below: 

(1) Download the python source package 

Open the Python source package download page: Python Source Releases | Python.org 

![avatar]( 7a63a81c460ee686e01fc5e597d3c8e2.png) 

Click the Latest Python 3 Release link to enter the python source package download page. Slide down to the bottom of the page in the download page, and then directly click the Gzipped source tarball link to download the python source package in gzip format: 

![avatar]( 81cbf790b6c4b0e27210354787a1a9a2.png) 

In Linux system, you can also download the source code package of python3 directly from the command line through the wget command. Download link of Python source code package: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/Python-3.7.4.tgz 

Usage of downloading using the wget command:

 ```  
If you need to download other versions of python, you can directly replace the version number in the link, for example, download python 3.5.1: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz 

(2) Unzip the Python source package 

Upload the gzip archive to your Linux system via tools such as FTP, and then use Linux tar command to unzip it. 

The compressed package file downloaded by the author is Python-3.7.4, and the decompression command is: 

 ```python

 ```  
The decompressed directory is Python-3.7.4, execute the cd Python-3.7.4 command on the command line to enter the source directory. 

The directory structure is as follows: 

![avatar]( dc4af6bdc47a053bb80e9d13caeda6d8.png) 

>  Beginners need to be familiar with the Linux system and will use common commands. For example, the "ls" command in the screenshot is actually the abbreviation of the English word "list", which means "list". For more meanings and usage of the ls command, readers can consult the official documentation or make good use of search engines. Linux configure and make. Configure is a script configuration tool in Linux, which is used to detect the current installation environment of the source code. If the detection is correct, it will generate a Makefile script file for source code compilation in the current directory. Make is a compilation and installation tool under the Linux system, which is used to explain the compilation and installation commands in the makefile file. 

(3) Generating Python Makefiles 

Executing./configure in the current directory Python-3.7.4 generates a Makefile file. 

>  When using the configure command to generate a Makefile file, you can specify the --prefix parameter to specify the installation directory of python. The syntax is --prefix = "the path of your custom installation directory". If this parameter is not specified, then the default installation path of python in linux is/usr/local. The rules for compiling, linking and installing the source program are defined in the Makefile file, and the project source program can be automatically compiled through the Makefile file. 

Output after executing the configure command: 

![avatar]( 595558430bb412fd127fa8f2578b0b7e.png) 

​ 

(4) Compiling Python 

After the configure command ends, a Makefile file will be generated in the current directory, and then enter the make command source code to compile Python. The command output is shown in the following figure: 

![avatar]( 2bd4a76d39d86b2d41b5cb6c853ea6c6.png) 

(5) Install Python 

After the compilation is successful, execute the sudo make install command to start installing python. If no installation directory is specified, the default installation directory is/usr/local, and the corresponding python interpreter is installed in the/usr/local/python3/bin directory. After the installation is completed, execute/usr/local/python3/bin/python3.7 -V on the command line to see the version information of python. 

![avatar]( 855f20e3bb6a758f74a69b6ad97bd0ca.png) 

(6) Set up soft links 

The installed python can be executed by means of an absolute path, such as/usr/local/python3/bin/python3.7 in step 6. It is troublesome to execute python by typing a large path each time. In the Linux system, you can set a soft link for the installed python. The soft link here is similar to the file shortcut of the Windows system. Execute the following command to set a soft link for python: 

 ```python

 ```  
>  In the ln command, it is a soft link that sets the path on the left to the path on the right. The/usr/bin directory has been added to the Linux environment variables PATH, so executing python3 is equivalent to executing/usr/bin/python3. 

Pip is a package management tool for python, execute the following command to set up soft links for pip:

##  10.1.1 understand list types 

In our daily lives, we all come into contact with the data type "list", such as the table of contents of a book, the details of the bill at the checkout of the restaurant, the planning of the schedule, etc. The list type is a data collection that arranges the elements in the collection in order. The list type in Python is a data collection enclosed by the [] symbol, and the elements in the collection are separated by English commas. In the list type, any data type can be included: 

Python

 ```  
![avatar]( 747511447e2164c0a1cb516238055a5c.png) 

The data structure of a list is the same as that of a string, which is a linear sequential table structure. 

![avatar]( 4b99bf0a0086c1ac70d0e91dcb4a56d6.png) 

As can be seen from the figure, the list type also corresponds to a contiguous memory. 

>  Students who are not familiar with linear sequential table structures can review the content of Section 9.1, "Basic Concepts of Strings". 

In a linear sequential table structure, elements in a data collection can be accessed by indexing: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574581220
 ```  
>  Indexes in Python are numbered from 0, 0 for the first position, and 1 for the second position. Python also supports negative indices, which are numbered from -1, -1 for the penultimate position, -2 for the penultimate position, and so on. 

##  Type name of 10.1.2 list 

In interactive mode, type to output the type name of a string: 

>  >>> container = [1, '2', 3.0, True]

> >> type(container)

<class 'list'> 

From the output, the type of the list is named list. 

##  Definition of 10.1.3 List 

The list is defined by object definition and direct definition. 

(1) Object definition method 

The type name of the list is list, and you can directly execute help (list) in interactive mode to find the definition and usage of list: 

>  >>> help(list)

Help on class list in module builtins:

class list(object)

|  list(iterable=(), /)

|

|  Built-in mutable sequence.

|

|  If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.

|  The argument must be an iterable if specified. 

In the output of interactive mode, the form of list (iterable = (),/) is the object definition method. The parameter iterable represents an iterable object. Among the data types learned so far, string and list are both iterable objects. In Python, any data type that can iterate over the elements in the collection is an iterable object. The so-called traversal is to access the elements in the collection one by one. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
(2) Direct definition method 

The so-called direct definition method is to define a list directly through the [] symbol: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574581220
 ```  
List types can contain any data type, and now nested lists are defined by direct definition. The so-called nested list refers to the inclusion of a list in a list. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574581220
 ```  
We usually see pictures, tables, etc. as a two-dimensional data structure. 

##  10.1.4 Traverse Iterable Objects 

The simple data types in Python are all non-iterable objects. The simple data types learned so far are integers, floating-point types, and boolean types. Composite data types in Python are all iterable objects. For iterable objects, you can iterate over the elements in the collection in the for loop structure. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574581220
 ```  
##  10.1.5 knowledge points 

>  (1) A list type is a collection of data that arranges the elements in the collection in order

(2) In Python, the list type enclosed by [] is used, and the elements in [] are separated by English commas

(3) The type name of the list is list, and like string, the list is also a linear sequence structure

(4) Lists can be defined by object definition and direct definition

(5) Simple data types are non-iterable, and composite data types in Python are all iterable objects

(6) For iterable objects, you can iterate through the elements in the collection in a for loop

##  Common Operators in 10.2.1 Lists 

List type is an abstract data type. Abstract data type defines the operation method of the data type. In this section, we focus on manipulating lists through operators.

The commonly used operators for list types are shown in the following table:

##  10.2.2 [] operator: index access list 

In Section 9.2, we introduced how to access the characters in a string through an index. The list type is also a linear sequence structure, and like a string, you can access the elements of the list through an index. 

Operation syntax: 

Python

 ```  
String is a static data type that can only be read by indexing characters and cannot be modified. The list type can be modified by indexing elements. 

Indexes in Python are divided into positive and negative indices. Positive indices are numbered from 0 and represent the first element in the data set. Negative indices are numbered from -1 and represent the first to last element in the data set. Positive and negative index values must be within a valid range or an out-of-bounds access error message will be thrown. Students who are not familiar with this can review the content in Section 9.2. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574567984
 ```  
Variables in Python actually store the memory address. When assigning a list to another variable, the memory address of the list is actually assigned. After the assignment operation is completed, modifying the variable will affect the original list. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574567984
 ```  
For the above code example, students can understand it through the following figure. The numbers variable holds the address of the list in memory.

After assigning the variable numbers to the variable container, both the variable container and the variable numbers refer to the same list. 

![avatar]( ecd496c13f2c9200318b714cf6066a82.png) 

Students can verify in interactive mode and use id to output the memory address of the variable: 

> >> numbers = [1,2,3,4]

> >> container = numbers

> >> id(numbers)

2890924839944

> >> id(container)

2890924839944 

This assignment feature of lists is also known as shallow copying. Shallow copying refers to copying memory addresses. As opposed to shallow copying, deep copying copies all the data in memory to the new memory space. After deep copying, it does not affect the original data object. When assigning values to composite data types in Python, shallow copying is performed. 

##  10.2.3 [:] operator: slice of list 

The trimming operation syntax is the same as the string slicing operation. For those who are not familiar with this, please review the content in Section 9.2. After slicing the list, a new list is returned. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
##  10.2.4 + operator: addition of lists 

List addition is the process of combining elements from two lists into a new list. 

Operation syntax: 

Python

 ```  
##  10.2.5 * operator: multiplication of lists 

The "*" operator is used to repeatedly output a list and return a new one. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574567984
 ```  
The parameter number must be an integer number.

 ```  
##  Relational operations 10.2.6 lists 

Use relational operators to perform a relational operation on a list and return a result of type Boolean. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574567984
 ```  
Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574567984
 ```  
The relational operation of a list is an ordered comparison, where the ordered comparison starts from the first element of the list and is compared element by element. 

>  The two lists are equal only if the element values are the same and the order is the same. Otherwise, the size relationship of the list is determined by the size relationship of the element sequence. 

For example, in the code above, although the list right has only one element, the first element in right is greater than the first element in the list left. At this time, Python will directly determine that the list right is greater than the list left, even if the elements behind the list left are larger than the elements in the list right. Now the relationship operation of the list is simulated through the loop structure.

 ```  
##  10.2.7 in operator: find element 

Use the "in" operator to determine whether an element exists in the list, and return a boolean value of True if present, False otherwise. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python

##  10.2.8 knowledge points 

>  (1) A list type is a linear sequence structure that allows access to elements in a list through an index.

(2) String is a static data type that can only be read by indexing characters and cannot be modified. List types can be modified by indexing elements.

(3) Variables in Python store memory addresses. When assigning a list to other variables, the memory address of the list is actually assigned. After the assignment operation is completed, modifying the variable will affect the original list.

(4) Assignment to composite data types in Python is performed by shallow copying.

(5) The relationship operation of the list is to compare in order. The order comparison here starts from the first element of the list and compares element by element. Only if the element values are the same and the order is the same, the two lists are equal. Otherwise, the size relationship of the list is determined by the size relationship of the elements.
