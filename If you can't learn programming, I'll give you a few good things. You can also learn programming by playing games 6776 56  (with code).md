It's already 2023, why is learning still limited to reading books and watching videos? 

I can't get hands-on exercise by reading books and watching videos, and I'm at a loss as soon as I type code? I learned some theoretical knowledge, but I don't know where to find project practice to stabilize my knowledge points? 

Today, I would like to recommend a few good things to you to enhance your programming learning by playing games!

###  CodinGame | Gamification programming teaching platform 

Although CodinGame is related to games, it is not game development. It is just a simple game mode. The logic behind each exercise is connected to an actual game, allowing you to get real-time visual feedback, and you can also get actual rewards after completing the exercise. 

This platform is suitable for people with a certain programming foundation, and of course it also provides advanced practice at the corresponding level for experienced programmers.

For each exercise, you can choose your favorite language from over 20 programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, etc. The company's target users are people who already know some programming basics, but also provide matching challenges for experienced programmers.

In particular, multiplayer mode has recently become popular among programmers. In multiplayer mode, you can learn the basics of artificial intelligence and compete with others to see whose code is more efficient.

###  Second, CodeCombat | From easy to difficult games, from shallow to deep learning

According to XIao's demo, he said: "Even the English hand code Xiaobai can play happily for a night", so it is estimated that everyone can easily get started even if they have no basics. Teleportation: https://codecombat.cn/

###  IV. Codewars | Programming Monster Upgrade Platform 

The Chinese name of Codewars is "Code Wars". Compared with other platforms, the questions given by Codewars are more suitable for actual work and life. Many questions will give the background of the questions, which is more immersive. 

Some KYU (an indicator used in Codewars to mark the difficulty of the questions) are smaller, but there are still some challenges. Many questions may require more than ten submissions in a day or two, but writing three or four hundred lines and then AC feels really great. 

Many of the questions come from games, and I often smile when I encounter these questions.

###  SCREEPS | MMO Sandbox Game for Programmers 

SCREEPS is a massively multiplayer online sandbox game in which the core mechanism is to program your unit AI.

  Screeps still looked interesting, but it was still a fly in the ointment. Although Screeps was open-source and could be downloaded at will, the game's server level was charged, so they could only play the free part, limited to the initial tutorial and training ground (sandbox mode), and the game content could not be saved. 

So whether you want to enter the pit or not, you can try the free part before deciding.
