Recently, I have received many private messages from college fans. Most fans are confused about how to learn computer in college and find a good job after graduation. 

Maybe it's because I've been answering a lot of questions in this area recently. I really dreamed of going back to college last night. In fact, I've worked for more than 20 years, worked as an executive, started a business, and almost didn't write a book. 

You don't have to ask me in private messages whether there is any good learning method for university computers. I will write an article for you today. If you can follow this method, you can definitely beat more than 90% of the same students when you graduate. 

The article is a bit long, but it will definitely give you a good harvest!

Everyone should have heard the saying "A university without failing a course is not a complete university", right? I don't know which bastard is full and keeps putting it on the wrong child, don't fail a course! 

First, it is a waste of time to fail the make-up exam, especially for some non-professional cultural courses, such as Marx, etc. If you have the time to take the make-up exam, you may be able to find someone; 

Second, if there is a first time, there may be a second time. Failing the first time doesn't feel as serious as I imagined. There are a few more people next door who have hung up than me, and it's okay. If this kind of mentality occurs, it will be out of control.

The first language taught in many universities is C language, which may be a bit uncomfortable for college students without a basic foundation. Sometimes, it is normal to see teachers operating fiercely in class, but it is difficult to do it yourself. Ten lines of code and eight lines of error are reported, and even the pointer cannot be understood. 

But don't give up easily. The two main things that programmers do on this path are to create and solve problems. They must develop their own problem-solving skills. 

There are many ways to solve the problem. You can ask your classmates or teachers around you, or you can go to the Internet to find resources to see. If the teacher doesn't understand what he teaches, go to the Internet to find other teachers' explanations for this piece, such as courses on MOOCs at Chinese universities, such as some courses at Bilibili, some blogger's blogs, and some technical exchange groups, are all ways to solve the problem. 

As long as you persevere, you will eventually become the person you envy.

Most universities pay attention to a comprehensive approach to the training of students. The tiles fired from the same kiln are not very different. If you want to be unique, you have to jump out of this knowledge circle and extend to areas that are not covered by the training program. 

The extension here is not a blind extension, but to determine your career direction. Programmers have many sub-professions. You can check it out on Baidu, choose your favorite career, and then go to job websites such as 51job and Boss Zhipin to see more about the job requirements of related occupations. See what you need to master to do this job, and then find resources to learn these skills. After you come out, you are the person the company needs.

The school may teach you many languages, C, C++, Java, C #, Python may teach, but you have to remember that the school teaches these to take you to the beginning, the rest of the things still need you to go to deep learning, with the above mentioned career direction to learn, such as want to do backend engineer, then you can consider using Java or other languages to learn in depth. 

I remember when I went to college to do graduate recruitment, I preferred to ask "what language are you proficient in", and many college students answered "I know everything", but I don't know that this is an answer that is bound to be PASS, so those who learn computers must be proficient in at least one language, and if they can solve 90% of the problems in this language, they are proficient.

Almost all application software requires a database in the background. Crawlers, data analytics, web development, and other aspects are all involved in the database. Generally, larger-scale data will be used in the database. The computer itself is inextricably linked to a large amount of data. This is a must. 

No matter whether it is a SQL database or a NoSQL database, it is enough to master one. I suggest that college students can master the MySQL database. It is currently one of the most popular databases. Its open-source, free, and small but fast features make it popular among many small and medium-sized enterprises.

If you want to be more advanced, then learn Oracle, which is currently the most popular relational database management system in the world. 

The principles of computer networking may have been rarely used when you were in college, or you didn't use them much when you first started working, but after a few years of working, you can't develop anything at the level of previous years, right? 

Good programmers are very familiar with the principles of computer networks, otherwise anything you create that involves network problems can only be attributed to the poor wifi signal, which means they are not familiar with network principles. 

At this time, if you can learn it well in college, although it won't be needed in a short time, it will be much easier to pick it up later.

All Mini Programs or software run on top of data structures. Data structures are not only used to organize data, but also greatly affect the running speed of the code. Because of different data structures, the running speed of the code may vary by many orders of magnitude. If the data structure is not good, once the amount of data is too large, the product will collapse. 

How important is the algorithm? To use an analogy, language and technology are like moves, so the algorithm is the internal strength you cultivate. No matter how eye-popping the moves are, if the internal strength is not good, it is not a matter of kicking? 

Therefore, there is a saying in the industry that "good program = data structure + algorithm". To write good programs, you must master data structures and algorithms.

There are many competitions for computer-related majors, such as Ali's Tianchi Big Data Competition, Huawei's Huawei Software Elite Challenge, etc., which have a high gold content in China. For example, national competitions such as the National College Computer Ability Challenge, not to mention, if you have the opportunity, you can also participate in some international competitions, such as the ACM International College Student Programming Competition, etc., which are all good choices for experience and gold plating. 

Participating in these high-value professional competitions not only enhances your professional knowledge, but also enriches your resume. It is even possible to be directly appointed by large enterprises in the competition.

Of course, not everyone can participate in professional competitions and achieve results, so in this case, I suggest doing a sustainability maintenance project, which is suitable for the vast majority of computer students. 

>  For example, if you want to build a mall website, you may only learn a little front-end HTML and CSS at the beginning, and you can only make a very simple 1.0 version of the webpage, which is so simple that you rarely see such a bad thing. It doesn't matter. After you learn JS and render more special effects for the webpage, you will start to form a 2.0 version that looks good. Then you learn back-end knowledge such as databases and servers, and you start to update it with different versions. Not only do you have front-end vision, but you also have a more complete back-end. You can even add social functions, intelligent recommendation functions, and so on. 

As you continue to maintain this project, it will continue to become more advanced and improved. Eventually, you can add it to your resume, and as soon as the work is taken out, you will say that I have developed such a website alone. The interviewer will take a look at this website and ask you some technical questions. You can also answer them. It seems that you did it yourself, so you are likely to stand out from the many interviewees. 

But remember, don't go online to find someone else's project source code to piece together directly. It's pointless. You can refer to it, but that's just a reference. You still have to write your own code. It may take a long time, but you only know what went wrong. This is your project.

Today's sharing is a bit long. If it helps you, or someone around you is in college, you can forward it for them to see. Maybe one of your casual moves can wake up the sleeping person. 

Finally, send everyone a word, not idle, idle must not be idle, come on! 

Thank you for reading and liking. I have collected a lot of technical dry goods that can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:
