###  Are you still using the traditional development interface? 

It's not better than not knowing, it's a surprise, it's 2023, are you still writing code with Pycharm's default background? It's outdated.

But after reading the background of the development environment of young people now, I am ashamed to see it.

Later, I will introduce to you how to change the background. 

###  The interface of young people 

Let's take a look at the development interface of young people today. I find the last one rather bizarre.

 I heard that it is a popular anime in China. I have never read it, but I have read a lot of novels.   

I've even seen a female programmer's pycharm interface look like this, directly putting Peng Yuyan up.

Some young people even hung Internet celebrity photos directly on the interface, saying that it was more refreshing than drinking Red Bull...

And mine is relatively low, after all, not young......

Next, let me share with you how to change the background of your pycharm. 

###  Third, the operation of changing the background 

It only takes three steps to make your PyCharm interface unique. 

Open PyCharm, click File, and select Settings.

In the Appearance & Behavior option, click Appearance, click Background Image.

Click on the "..." place in the upper right corner, and you can choose the picture you want to use as the background. After confirming, choose the display method you like. I think the second method is still good.

The last thing is to set the brightness of the background image. I suggest that the brighter background should be about the same at 10% transparency. If it is too bright, it will affect the code, personal preference and picture color.
